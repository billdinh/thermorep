              <ol>
                  <li id="preparation-step--0-0">
<strong>Day 1</strong>: Place 100 g of the flour and 140 g of the water into mixing bowl and mix <nobr>10 sec/speed 5</nobr>, or until combined.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--0-1">Transfer into a large ceramic or glass bowl. Cover with cheese cloth and set aside in a warm place (between 33-40°C - see Tips) for 24 hours. Clean and dry mixing bowl.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--0-2">
<strong>Day 2</strong>: There should be visible signs of fermentation (such as an alcohol-like odour) - this indicates the fermentation process has begun. Place bowl with starter onto mixing bowl lid and weigh 50 g of the flour and 70 g of the water into it. Stir to combine. Cover with cheese cloth and set aside in a warm place (between 33-40°C) for 24 hours.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--0-3">
<strong>Day 3</strong>: Activity (fermentation) will have increased. You should see a visible separation into two layers, with a slightly spongy layer forming on the surface. Remove half of the starter from the bowl and set aside (see Tips). Place bowl with remaining starter onto mixing bowl lid and weigh 50 g of the flour and 70 g of the water into it. Stir to combine. Cover with cheese cloth and set aside in a warm place (between 33-40°C) for 24 hours.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--0-4">
<strong>Day 4</strong>: Depending on the level of activity (fermentation), your starter could be ready today. When your starter is ready, it will be thick, frothy and bubbly, with a sour smell. If your starter is ready for baking, move on to the Gluten free sourdough bread (step 7). If your starter is still developing on day 4, remove half of the sourdough starter and set aside (see Tips). Place bowl with remaining starter onto mixing bowl lid and weigh 50 g flour and remaining 70 g water into it. Stir to combine. Cover with cheese cloth and set aside in a warm place (between 33-40°C) for 24 hours.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--0-5">
<strong>Days 5-7</strong>: Repeat removing and adding to starter as needed (50 g flour and 70 g water), covering and setting aside in a warm place on days 5 and 6. Once the mixture is thick, bubbly and sour-smelling, it is ready to use (see Tips).</li>

              <ol>
                  <li id="preparation-step--1-0">Grease a loaf tin (22 x 10 cm) and set aside.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--1-1">Place flours, chia seeds, xanthan gum, salt and sugar into mixing bowl and mix <nobr>5 sec/speed 5</nobr>. Transfer into a bowl and set aside.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--1-2">Place eggs, 300 g of the water, vinegar and 170 g of the reserved gluten free sourdough starter into mixing bowl and mix <nobr>1 min/speed 5</nobr>.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--1-3">Add reserved flour mixture and mix 
          <strong>30 sec/speed 5</strong>.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--1-4">Scrape down sides of mixing bowl with spatula and knead <nobr>3 min/</nobr>. Transfer mixture into prepared loaf tin, smoothing down surface with damp fingertips. Score the top of bread diagonally 3-4 times with a sharp knife, then cover with a piece of perforated plastic wrap, ensuring plastic wrap doesn't touch dough. Set aside in a warm place to prove for 10-12 hours (between 33-40°C). Spray bread with water before baking.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--1-5">Place oven racks into centre and bottom positions in oven. Place a large ovenproof baking dish onto bottom rack. Preheat oven to 190°C. Place a bowl or large jug onto mixing bowl lid and weigh remaining 700 g water into it. Place loaf tin with dough onto top rack in oven. Quickly but carefully pour water into baking dish to create steam and immediately close oven door to trap the steam. Bake for 50 minutes (190°C), or until golden brown. Leave bread to cool in tin for 5 minutes, then transfer onto a wire rack to cool before slicing and serving. </li>

              <h3 id="hints-and-tricks-title">Hints &amp; Tricks</h3>
                <ul>
          <li>To make your own buckwheat and rice flours, place 250 g buckwheat or brown rice into mixing bowl and mill <strong>2 min/speed 10</strong>. Use as needed.</li>
          <li>If you live in a cool climate or are making sourdough during autumn or winter, you can prove your bread by placing it into a low oven (35°C-40°C) or place bowl with starter into a warm water bath to facilitate fermentation.</li>
          <li>Don't discard the starter you have removed from the mother - give it to friends or family so they can develop their own starter, or experiment by feeding the removed starter with different types of flours. Adding different flour combinations will result in various flavours and textures.</li>
          <li>Depending on the environment and temperature, your starter may be ready from day 4.</li>
          <li>Once your starter has fully fermented, store in the refrigerator (to "put it to sleep") or it will over-ferment and lose its rising ability. An over-fermented starter will have a noxious smell and may have mould on top. If this occurs, discard starter and start from step 1.</li>
          <li>If you are planning to bake a loaf of sourdough from a "sleepy" starter, take the starter out of the refrigerator, feed it with 50 g flour and 70 g water and set aside in a warm place for 12 hours to re-activate ("wake it up").</li>
          <li>You need to keep your starter alive by feeding it once a week. Do this by whisking in 50 g flour and 70 g water.</li>
