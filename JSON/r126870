Line the bottom of the tin with 2 half sheets filo pastry, brush with melted butter and cover with the almond and sugar mixture. Cover with the 2 remaining half sheets of filo pastry and brush with melted butter. Bake in oven for 20 minutes (180°C). Remove from oven, brush with the remaining honey and butter and allow to cool before serving."}],"hintsAndTricks":["Depending on the size of the mould used, you may need to use 1 or 2 additional sheets of filo pastry.","Orange blossom water is a by-product of the distillation of fresh bitter-orange blossoms for their essential oil. In Moroccan cuisine, it is mainly used as an ingredient for traditional sweets. If you are unable to find orange blossom water, use any flavouring to your liking (vanilla, cinnamon etc.). This however, will not result in the typical flavour of the briouats."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","35m","4 portions"]}
