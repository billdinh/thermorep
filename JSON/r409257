They're also a source of magnesium, calcium, iron and vitamin B6.","Use a lighter-flavoured, but still extra virgin olive oil for these muffins. Extra virgin olive oil retains its natural polyphenols and is a more natural and nutritious option than refined olive oil."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","50m","12 portions"]}
