This sauce doesn't freeze solid so you can scoop out only the amount you need.","You can cook these ribs on the barbecue, if desired. After baking ribs in oven, remove and grill over low heat, while basting occasionally with sauce, until caramelised and slightly charred. If using a barbecue hot plate, lay baking paper down first so glaze does not burn too much."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","5h 50m","4 portions"]}
