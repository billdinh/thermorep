Tasty pasta and vegetable soup, a pork roll filled with flavourful bacon and sun-dried tomato stuffing, served with Mediterranean vegetables, followed by delightful steamed raspberry puddings (when baked instead of steamed, the batter produces completely different but equally wonderful berry muffins). Thermomix makes it all possible - and easy!<\/i>","To make your own jam, refer to the recipe in <i>The Basic Cookbook<\/i>.<br>- To save time, ask your butcher to butterfly your pork for you.<br>- For the puddings, use any heat-resistant individual muffin or pudding moulds that fit 4 on Varoma tray. <br>-  After baking, allow muffins to cool for <b>5 minutes<b> in the tin, then transfer to a cooling rack. Once at room temperature, sprinkle with icing sugar, store in a sealable container and serve within <b>24 hours.<b> <br>- For a special treat, serve a spoonful of whipped cream or crème fraîche with the steamed puddings.<br>- If you have room in your refrigerator, you can prepare this recipe the night before. Proceed until <b>step 9,<b> stopping just before steaming. Place prepared Varoma, mixing bowl and simmering basket in the refrigerator. When ready to finish, continue recipe from steaming in <b>step 9.<b>","Use different berries or small pieces of mango or banana for the muffins.<br>- Use other jams or marmalades in the steamed puddings instead of raspberry jam."],"basicInfo":["medium","45m","1h 40m","4 portions"]}
