Their spherical shape is said to represent continuity and reunion and will bring good fortune to the family.","Different brands of glutinous rice flour will require different amounts of water. The dough should be a little powdery but it should be possible to form dough balls without sticking to hands.","If dough begins to crack when forming balls, use a little water to moisten the dry areas and bind the dough together.","Uncooked dumplings can be refrigerated for later use.","If the surface of the dumplings cracks after refrigeration, rub a little water on the cracks then dip in glutinous rice flour to prevent cracking during cooking."],"basicInfo":["medium","25m","30m","10 pieces"]}
