They are cooked when the outside browns slightly, with the interior remaining white, almost translucent.","Be sure to choose a variety of apple that maintains its shape during cooking.","Flambéing is the process of setting fire to alcohol that has been poured over food. Once on fire, the alcohol burns off quickly. To flambé safely follow these guidelines:","Never pour from an open bottle into a pan near a naked flame.<br>","After adding the alcohol, ignite it immediately without delay.","Ignite using a long match or barbecue lighter, and always light the alcohol fumes near the edge not the actual liquid.<br>","Wait for the flames to die out.<br>","The pancakes can also be made with regular plain flour.","If your pancakes are very thin, serve them <em>aumonières<\/em> (tied like money bags) on the plate, with the sauce poured over."],"basicInfo":["medium","30m","1h 10m","6 portions"]}
