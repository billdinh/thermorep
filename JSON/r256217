Slowly simmering the beef in wine over an extended period of time helps tenderise the meat, but this \"cheat's version\" produces a tasty dish in less than an hour.","You can replace the Burgundy wine with any good-quality red wine in this recipe.","Please refer to <i>The Basic Cookbook<\/i> for the Vegetable stock paste recipe.","You can replace plain flour with gluten free flour, if desired","Serve with mashed potato instead of bread, if desired."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","40m","4 portions"]}
