Make sure if using a smaller pan that you extend the height of pan by adding 2 inches of parchment to the inner edges for all three layers to fit.","Parchment paper: make sure to line sides of pan first then add a layer of parchment to the base of pan, covering up about ½ inch of the sides. Press parchment smooth before adding ice cream.","This recipe is best made three days in advance to allow ice cream to fully freeze before churning."],"basicInfo":["medium","30m","48h","16 slices"]}
