Grilling time will vary.","The chicken pieces can also be grilled without skewers. Instead, place directly on baking tray lined with foil, turning pieces of chicken with tongs during grilling so evenly browned and cooked.","These ‘little pieces’ (the literal translation of ‘tikka’) of chicken were not commonly found here until the 1970s when tandoori cooking spread rapidly to most curry houses. Traditionally baked on a skewer in a clay oven, these tasty little chicken chunks can be served hot or cold either as they are or stirred into a masala sauce to make chicken tikka masala – one of the UK and Ireland’s most popular dishes!"],"basicInfo":["easy","30m","3h 30m","4 portions"]}
