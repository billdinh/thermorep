Steamed apples and sweet potatoes accompany the cheese and bacon-filled chicken roll, and the apple flavour is echoed in the curry sauce. Beef extract gives colour and umami flavour to the juicy, tender meat, and if you wish, you can add even more colour by browning the rolls briefly in a hot pan before serving.","If the cooking apple is not very tart, add the optional vinegar.","The apples for steaming can be left unpeeled if desired.","In <b>step 7,<b> instead of further steaming, pan-fry the chicken rolls to complete cooking if they appear underdone, or just to add browning."],"basicInfo":["medium","40m","1h 25m","4 portions"]}
