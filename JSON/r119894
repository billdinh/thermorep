To make your own at home, roast capsicums over a gas flame, turning with tongs until blackened all over. Place into a glass bowl and cover with plastic wrap for 10 minutes or until cooled. Peel and discard skin and deseed before using.","Cevapcici will have more flavour when using fatty cuts of meat; consider beef chuck or blade, lamb shoulder and pork shoulder or neck. Be sure to partially freeze the meat first to make cutting easier. When cutting into cubes, cut through the fat so that it minces better. You can also purchase minced meat from your butcher.","To partially freeze meat, place in a flat container and freeze for 30 minutes.","We served Cevapcici with Zhoug (please refer to the recipe on this recipe chip)."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","50m","12 portions"]}
