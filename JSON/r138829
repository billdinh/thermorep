To use, bring back to room temperature or stir until soft enough for spreading.","You can decorate your mini monsters any way you like using any kind of lollies. For ideas, please use the cupcakes in the image as a guide. For example, use white bullets for teeth; use thin strips of black licorice for the mouth, eyelashes or stitches; or cover with candy eyes to make an \"all-seeing\" monster."],"basicInfo":["easy","1h","1h 25m","24 portions"]}
