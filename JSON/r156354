However, sweet chilli sauce can be served as a dip for this dish, if desired.<br>- You can find glutinous rice in Asian supermarkets, or replace it with any other sticky rice, such as sushi rice.","You can replace pork belly with pork mince, provided the pork mince is fatty <b>(30% fat),<b> as pork fat is necessary to give the meatballs their smooth and soft texture. If using pork mince, omit freezing and initial steps."],"basicInfo":["medium","30m","2h","32 pieces"]}
