Line a baking tray with baking paper and place in oven.","On a well floured surface, flatten the bread balls with your hand as much as you can, and stretch and shape the dough using your fingers, lifting up the edges and pushing outwards gently. Avoid making holes in the dough. Form 12 cm-15 cm square shapes, as thin as possible. Repeat this step for remaining dough balls.","Arrange dough squares on preheated baking tray and bake for 3-4 minutes (200°C) until bread is just cooked, and still soft enough to roll. Roll up loosely and cool on a wire rack.","To cook falafels, place flour in a bowl and roll falafels in flour. Pour oil in a non-stick frying pan to a depth of  2-3 cm, and heat on the hob. Carefully place a few balls at a time into the hot oil, making sure they don't stick to the bottom. Cook for about 6 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown all over. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Serve falafel with square flatbreads and tahini sauce."]}],"ingredients":[{"title":"Tahini Sauce","content":["2 garlic cloves","3 sprigs fresh flat-leaf parsley, leaves only","150 g tahini","130 g water","1 Tbsp lemon juice","¾ - 1 tsp fine sea salt, to taste","½ - ¾ tsp ground cumin, to taste"]},{"title":"R’gaif Bread","content":["180 g water","20 g fresh yeast, crumbled","260 gram wheat flour, plus extra for dusting","½ tsp fine sea salt","oil, for greasing"]},{"title":"Falafel","content":["4 spring onions, cut in pieces","4 garlic cloves","5 g fresh parsley","4 sprigs fresh mint, leaves only","½ fresh red chilli, deseeded","1 tsp baking powder","720 g tinned chick peas, drained","1 tsp fine sea salt","1 tsp ground cumin","1 tsp ground coriander"]},{"title":"Finalising R’gaif Bread and Falafel","content":["400 gram wheat flour, plus extra for dusting","oil, for frying"]}],"id":"r170304","imageLink":"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-IuH2gcZW12s\/XZaqSdjbyJI\/AAAAAAAAhbU\/ypP_JXX9HK8_QV1k2Pl3zzuy0eTELLbxACLcBGAsYHQ\/s1600\/0_URYvKrgiO74ZbD53.png","title":"Falafel in Square Flatbread (R’gaif Bread) with Tahini Sauce","publishedAt":"2017-05-29T00:00:00Z","nutrition":{"protein":"42 g","fat":"42 g","uom":"per 1 portion","carbohydrates":"177 g","calories":"53679 kJ \/ 1282 kcal"},"usefulItems":"cling film, baking tray and paper, paper towels, wire rack, large non-stick frying pan, slotted spoon, refrigerator, hob, oven, freezer","hintsAndTricks":["The falafel balls can be stored in the freezer at the end of step 6.","Add a cucumber salad to the falafel and flatbread."],"basicInfo":["medium","1h","1h 25m","4 portions"]}
