We recommend using an oven thermometer. For a more even rise on your soufflés, use a conventional oven, if possible (not fan forced).","We used Top 'N' Fill caramel in our soufflés. You can make your own caramel in your Thermomix (see recipes on www.cookidoo.com.au), however it needs to be very thick for the soufflés to rise correctly (you should be able to stand a spoon in the caramel).","Serve with cream or ice cream, if desired."],"basicInfo":["advanced","15m","35m","8 portions"]}
