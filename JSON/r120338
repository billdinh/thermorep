Cut a lid from the pumpkin and scoop out seeds.  Immerse pumpkin into boiling water (top up with water as needed to cover) for 5-10 minutes, then carefully transfer pumpkin into a large container of cold water to stop cooking. Place the pumpkin upside down on a wire rack to drain. To serve, fill the pumpkin with soup, garnish with bacon and sour cream and serve immediately.
