Rinse brown basmati rice before cooking. Cook rice for an extra 5 minutes more than chicken.","Save time by making the chicken parcel the night before, refrigerate and let marinate overnight.","Bulgur wheat comes in different varieties. Please read package directions for cooking times and rinsing if required before cooking. If your bulgur requires 30 minutes just leave it in mixing bowl after turning over the chicken and continue for the extra 10 minutes."],"basicInfo":["easy","5m","40m","6 portions"]}
