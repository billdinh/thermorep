Take a chopstick or any similar sized object and make a deep indentation in the center of the circle, without breaking through the dough. Fold over one third of each round and press down to seal. Arrange these folded rolls on a buttered baking sheet about 1\/2 inch apart and continue with recipe."],"basicInfo":["medium","10m","2h 20m","12 portions"]}
