Omit salt and break into small pieces (do not serve whole as bliss balls can be a choking hazard). Because of the high levels of natural sugars in dried apricots, offer these in moderation.","<b>Toddler's serve<b>: serve as per baby's serve, omitting or reducing salt.","Be sure to use a pure peanut butter made from 100 per cent nuts and free from refined oils and added sugar. Alternatively, you can use whichever nut butter you have on hand e.g. cashew butter, if preferred. You can also make your own peanut butter or nut butter in your Thermomix - you'll find the recipes on Cookidoo.","When buying desiccated coconut and dried apricots, try to choose brands with no added sulphur dioxide. Organic brands are generally sulphur-free. Sulphur dioxide (220) is a preservative that's been associated with a range of food intolerance symptoms and it can particularly affect asthma sufferers.","Feel free to increase the amount of spice you use as desired.","If the weather is warm, you may find it easier to chill the mixture in the fridge for an hour before rolling.","You can store these bliss balls in a sealable container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","1h 20m","24 pieces"]}
