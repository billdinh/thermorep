Chop frozen butter into flour in seconds, then create the layers by rolling and folding the pastry. It also freezes well – simply defrost in the fridge before baking.","This pastry serves as a base for cakes, pastries, cream puffs and fruit tarts.","The success of this recipe depends on keeping the pastry dough chilled so the layers of butter do not melt. A cold work surface (marble or stone) and a cool room temperature are helpful. If at any time during the process the dough feels warm, place in the freezer for <b>5 minutes<b> before rolling out again. To prevent the dough from sticking to the work surface, whenever necessary use a light dusting of flour, or roll dough between two sheets of baking paper.","Puff pastry dough freezes very well before baking. Defrost in the fridge before using. Partially rolling out the dough before freezing allows for faster defrosting.","Once baked, pastry keeps well for up to <b>15 days<b> stored in a sealed container in a cool dry place.","Replace water with very cold white wine."],"basicInfo":["medium","20m","1h 20m","1"]}
