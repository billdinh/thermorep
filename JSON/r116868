Activating nuts is actually a traditional practice that historically required the soaking of both nuts and seeds in salty water and letting them dry in the sun. Without the level of sunshine required to do this in many countries and with slightly more sanitary methods of drying we can activate nuts in our own kitchens. We can do this by a) using a dehydrator for around 12-24 hours or using an oven, at the lowest temperature possible, preferably no more than 65°C. Stir or turn them occasionally, for the required drying time.","Almonds : 1 tsp salt per 1 cup nuts, soak for 12-14 hours then dry for 12-24 hours.","Cashews: 1 tsp salt per 1 cup nuts, soak 3-6 hours* then dry for 12-24 hours.","Macadamias: 1 tsp salt per 1 cup nuts, soak 7-12 hours then dry for 12-24 hours.","Walnuts: ½ tsp salt per 1 cup nuts, soak 7-12 hours then dry for 12-24 hours.","<p>Recipe developed by Jenny Tschiesche BSc(Hons) Dip(ION) FdSc BANT.
