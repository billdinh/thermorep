It has a strong odour, but the aroma softens as it cooks, and it tastes similar to onion and garlic, enhancing the savoury flavour of the dish. It helps reduce flatulence and constipation, and reduce the growth of microflora in the gut. A little goes a long way, so you only need to use a small amount. You can find asafoetida at Indian grocers or online.","Toor dal (also known as split pigeon peas) are a split, yellow lentil and can be found in some supermarkets and most Indian food stores."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","1h 30m","6 portions"]}
