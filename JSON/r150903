Feel free to use a normal orange jam or marmalade with the extra lemon juice if you can’t find a Seville variety. Marinating and steaming the duck makes it beautifully tender. Can serve four if required – see variations.<\/i>","Replace green beans with vegetables of your choice in <b>step 6,<b> for instance thinly sliced carrots, halved Brussels sprouts, shredded savoy cabbage, sliced red peppers or pak choi. Place the vegetables that require the longest steaming time in the simmering basket first.<br>- To <b>serve 4,<b> use <b>4 duck<b> breasts, increase ingredients for marinade by <b>1½ times,<b> and double the ingredients for mashed potatoes and beans. Water for steaming and the recipe instructions remain unchanged.","Potatoes must be cooked through and tender before mashing to create a creamy mash that is lump-free and not gluey. In <b>step 4,<b> cook potatoes <b>5-10 minutes<b> longer if needed - cooking time depends on potato variety.<br>- If you buy duck breasts with skin, they should be <b>approx. 225-300 g each.<b> Peel off skin and fat with the help of a small sharp knife before marinating duck.<br>- Duck breasts can be marinated for up to <b>24 hours<b> before steaming.
