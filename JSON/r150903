Feel free to use a normal orange jam or marmalade with the extra lemon juice if you can’t find a Seville variety. Marinating and steaming the duck makes it beautifully tender. Can serve four if required – see variations.<\/i>","Replace green beans with vegetables of your choice in <nobr>step 6,<\/nobr> for instance thinly sliced carrots, halved Brussels sprouts, shredded savoy cabbage, sliced red peppers or pak choi.
