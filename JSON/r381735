You might like to start with softer options, such as pieces of avocado or steamed sweet potato, before progressing to slightly firmer foods like these pea cakes. By ten months, your baby should be given a wide variety of finger food options with plenty of different tastes and textures."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","25m","24 portions"]}
