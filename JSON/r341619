It can be bought from online retailers.","Sumac is a spice widely used in Turkey, the Lebanon, Syria, Armenia, Iran and also in Greece, where it is included in many dishes and is the essential ingredient for lamb, veal or beef kebabs. It is a fruity spice, with a delicate lemon flavour. It can be replaced with lemon or lemon balm in seafood or fish dishes. It can be used to flavour salads, poultry and meat balls, but also rice, vegetable and egg dishes, as well as bread. It makes an excellent sauce when mixed with yoghurt.","Sumac has a tendency to deteriorate when cooked. It is therefore preferable not to overcook it. It can also make food very salty. Therefore take care not to over-salt the mixture.","Za'atar is a thyme-based Middle Eastern spice mix. It is sometimes called Aleppo thyme. Like many spice mixes, the proportions vary from one grocer to another. However, za'atar is generally made up of thyme, oregano, savory, sesame seeds, sumac, marjoram and possibly green anise, coriander and cumin.","Any leftover za'atar can be stored in an airtight container and used to season chicken, beef or seafood before cooking or simply serve with bread and olive oil."],"basicInfo":["easy","35m","1h 40m","4 portions"]}
