Early versions were cooked over a hot fire or on a heated tile, similar to early flatbreads. Unlike flatbread, however, bakers ‘dimple’ the top of focaccia with their hands or the handle of a utensil, before drizzling with olive oil to preserve moisture. Typically eaten plain or with ingredients incorporated into the dough, focaccia is a classic Italian bread that is enjoyed all over the world. This version combines the classic combination of pear and Gorgonzola, making this simple bread even more delicious.","Lightly grease cling film to prevent it from sticking to the dough during the resting and leavening stages."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","1h 55m","6 portions"]}
