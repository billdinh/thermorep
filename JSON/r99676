They are approx. 6 cm deep with a volume of 110 ml.","The toffee sauce is also delicious poured over vanilla ice cream as a dessert by itself.","If the sticky toffee sauce separates in the fridge, stir before using.","Steam as one large pudding in a deep spring form tin (Ø 20 cm) lined with buttered greaseproof paper on the base. Steam for 40-45 minutes or until a skewer inserted in centre comes out clean.","Raisins and\/or sultanas can be used instead of dates.","The sauce makes approx. 200 ml. To double the sauce, double all ingredients and cook with the same timings. Extra sauce keeps well in the fridge for 2-3 months.","Sponge puddings stay beautifully moist when they are steamed, and the Varoma is perfect for this. Cosy, comforting and indulgent, we’ve made sure there is a sticky toffee sauce to go with these puddings too! It’s lovely with pouring cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream to offset the warmth."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","1h","8 portions"]}
