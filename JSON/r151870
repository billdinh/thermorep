Do not stir, but occasionally swirl the saucepan, until sugar becomes a dark amber. At this point, carefully pour in <b>approx. 50 g hot<b> water (it will bubble up and spatter). Stir over medium heat until all caramel is dissolved and syrup thickens slightly. Allow to cool before using.","Glass yoghurt containers of approx. <b>125 ml<b> capacity make excellent moulds.","If using thicker jars, extend cooking time by 5-10 minutes.","To unmould, run a small sharp knife around the créme caramel, place a plate upside down on jar, flip jar and plate at the same time, hold them together tightly and give a sharp shake or two to loosen the créme caramel so that it falls on the plate.","Crème caramel, or flan, is a traditional dessert served in France and Spain.","To serve a larger crowd, double the quantities and bake in a preheated oven (140°C) in a bain marie for <b>1 hour 20 minutes<b>.
