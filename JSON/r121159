Pour over cooled cake and garnish with almonds.","This dairy-free sponge is simply delicious with a sharp, zesty taste from the lemons and fruitiness from the olive oil. The cake itself is dairy-free however I have garnished it with a delicious, smooth lemon curd that contains butter. If you prefer a dairy-free version I suggest a lemon icing instead of the curd (see variations). I used a good extra virgin olive oil that is quite bitter and fruity in taste however it’s your choice - you could use a lighter olive oil if you prefer, or even a cold pressed rapeseed oil would be perfect."],"basicInfo":["easy","35m","5h","8 portions"]}
