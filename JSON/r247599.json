Delicate roasted cauliflower florets are paired with fragrant, toasted hazelnuts that add a subtle crunch. Finished with an indulgent browned butter sauce, this is a modern pasta dish that will impress even the most seasoned pasta eaters.","It's common for Italian cooks to add a little starchy pasta cooking water as it helps to bring the sauce together and make it thicker and silkier.","To make this recipe suitable for vegetarians, substitute the Parmesan cheese for a vegetarian hard cheese."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","40m","6 portions"]}
