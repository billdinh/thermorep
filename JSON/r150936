Steaming time may need to be increased by <nobr>5-10 minutes<\/nobr> if the containers are not metal, or are larger than <nobr>110 ml<\/nobr> each.<br>- Puddings with sticky toffee sauce can also be served with cream or ice cream.<br>- The sauce makes approx. <nobr>200 ml.<\/nobr> To double it, double all sauce ingredients and cook with same timings. Extra sauce keeps well in a sterilised jar in the fridge for up to <nobr>3 months,<\/nobr> and if it separates when cold, stir before using.","Raisins can be used instead of dates.<br>- Steam as one large pudding in a deep <nobr>(Ø 20 cm)<\/nobr> springform tin lined with greased baking paper on the base, making sure some holes remain unobstructed so steam can circulate (placing a steaming rack or chopsticks on the bottom of the Varoma dish will raise the tin off the holes).
