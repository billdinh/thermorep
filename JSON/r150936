With your Thermomix, it’s easy to make and steam the puddings and it only takes a few minutes to make a gorgeous sticky toffee sauce.<\/i>","Puddings can be steamed in other small dishes or containers, such as <b>5-8 ramekins,<b> espresso cups, glasses, verrines or silicone muffin moulds, provided they are heatproof and fit in the Varoma dish. Steaming time may need to be increased by <b>5-10 minutes<b> if the containers are not metal, or are larger than <b>110 ml<b> each.<br>- Puddings with sticky toffee sauce can also be served with cream or ice cream.<br>- The sauce makes approx. <b>200 ml.<b> To double it, double all sauce ingredients and cook with same timings. Extra sauce keeps well in a sterilised jar in the fridge for up to <b>3 months,<b> and if it separates when cold, stir before using.","Raisins can be used instead of dates.<br>- Steam as one large pudding in a deep <b>(Ø 20 cm)<b> springform tin lined with greased baking paper on the base, making sure some holes remain unobstructed so steam can circulate (placing a steaming rack or chopsticks on the bottom of the Varoma dish will raise the tin off the holes).
