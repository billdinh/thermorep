Activated nuts have been soaked, which kick starts their germination process and then dehydrated. In general, the benefits of using activated nuts is that activation helps to break down the naturally-occurring phytic acid and improves nutrient absorption and digestibility. However, the cooking of this custard can affect the full activation benefits, so feel free to use whichever type of cashews you have on hand.","The dates add a natural sweetness to this custard so there is no need to use added sugars or syrups. The added benefits are that dates are a rich source of fibre (even more than spinach) and potassium (twice as much as bananas). They're also a source of magnesium, calcium and vitamin B6.","Don't be deterred by the cashews in this custard - they actually add a lovely creaminess. Cashews are a particularly good source of iron - a handful has as much iron as a lamb cutlet - which makes them a great toddler food, as iron deficiency is common in this age group.","If you prefer, you can replace the raw cacao powder with cocoa powder in this recipe.","Like cornflour, arrowroot flour can be used to thicken custards and sauces. Arrowroot is a good option if you wish to avoid genetically modified cornflour (although you can buy GMO-free cornflour). Just be sure to buy a pure, preservative free product.","You can serve this custard chilled; simply transfer into a sealable container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","20m","4 portions"]}
