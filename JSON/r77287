It’s also a great time-saver – cooking the chicken bones and skin in the simmering basket brings out the goodness and natural gelatine of the chicken bones at the same time as cooking the barley and creating your stock. The added beauty of this all-in-one recipe is that you can substitute the vegetables for whatever you have in your fridge."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","1h 30m","6 portions"]}
