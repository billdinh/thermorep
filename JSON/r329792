To press tofu, use a tofu press or line a plate with paper towels. Place tofu block on the paper towels and cover with another layer of paper towel. Place a plate or a cutting board on top of the paper towels, then place heavy weights (books or cans) on top. Set aside for several hours until liquid has been pressed out.","We recommend using organic tofu whenever possible.","Use the tofu off-cuts in our Leek quiche or Blue cheese tofu dressing (please refer to the recipes on this recipe chip).","With a cheesy, umami flavour, nutritional yeast contains all nine essential amino acids, is a great source of B vitamins and is often fortified with vitamin B12 (important for those following a vegan diet). You can find nutritional yeast at health food stores or online.","Be sure to check the label of your tamari, as not all brands are gluten free.","We used Australian mustard in this recipe but any mild yellow mustard can be used.","Kala namak, also known as Himalayan black salt, is a pungent smelling salt typically used in South Asian cuisine (and by vegans as it mimics the flavour and aroma of eggs). It can be purchased at health food stores, Indian food stores or online.","To make your own English muffins, please refer to the recipe on this recipe chip."],"basicInfo":["medium","20m","1h","4 portions"]}
