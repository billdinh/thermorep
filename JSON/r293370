A dense bread will not work for this recipe.","We served our fritters with <i>Rye loaf<\/i> and <i>Quick beetroot relish<\/i> (please refer to the recipes on this recipe chip) and pickles as part of a ploughman's platter. But you can also serve them with mashed potatoes or as burger patties (burgers are a great way to introduce children to liver and boost their iron intake!)."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","35m","12 portions"]}
