Scrub oysters clean and rinse under cool water.","Always be careful when shucking oysters, keep hands protected. Use a doubled tea towel or wear tough rubber or canvas gloves and hold the oyster firmly in one hand, curved side down. Using an oyster-shucking knife in the other hand, place the tip of the knife at the base of the hinge (pointy part of oyster), twist the knife using pressure, then without pressure, lever the knife upwards, or twist it to pry the hinge open. Slide the knife under the top shell to release the oyster and remove the shell."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","25m","6 pieces"]}
