Leave to cool then spread the surface of the sponge with marmalade lightly warmed in the microwave. Cover with lightly whipped cream flavoured with finely grated orange zest and orange juice, reduced in a saucepan to a syrup. Add orange syrup to lightly whipped cream when it is cold. Lightly roll the sponge into a swiss roll.","This sponge has a good flavour and texture combination making it suitable to line metal rings prior to filling with chocolate mousse.","Cook the sponge in a tin suitable for how you intend to use it.
