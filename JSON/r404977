Botanically, it's actually not a grain - it's a seed, from the same family as beetroot and spinach. You might like to add it to your fruit purées too (just cook it first following the same method as this recipe). It tends to thicken purées, so add as much water or your baby's milk as needed to achieve the desired consistency."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","40m","1"]}
