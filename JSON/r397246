However, you can serve fried banana alone (omit cacao nibs), blended, mashed or as finger food, as appropriate for your baby.","<strong>Toddler's serve<\/strong>: serve as is as an occasional treat, cut up as needed, keeping serving sizes small. You may wish to omit cacao nibs as they contain some caffeine.","You can replace the coconut sugar with Rapadura sugar in this recipe.","You can replace the double cream with pouring (whipping) cream in this recipe.","If you would prefer to avoid using plastic ice cube trays, you can instead pour the mixture into a glass or porcelain rectangular dish to freeze. Once frozen, use a sharp knife to cut mixture into cubes before placing back into the mixing bowl. Store any remaining coconut ice cream in the freezer for another occasion.","If you have only a 400 ml can of coconut milk on hand, you can use regular milk or pouring cream to make up the difference to 500 g (not suitable for dairy-free).
