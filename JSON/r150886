Adapt the toppings as you wish, choosing ingredients that will add both colour and flavour to the silky egg custard. Serve as a starter or as one of several small dishes as a main course. It can also be served chilled.<\/i>","Dashi, or Japanese cooking stock, adds flavour to chawan mushi. You can replace instant dashi powder with <nobr>½ tsp homemade<\/nobr> chicken or vegetable stock paste: first dilute the stock paste in water before adding it in <nobr>step 1,<\/nobr> and reduce salt to <nobr>¼ tsp.<\/nobr> Or omit instant dashi powder and use <nobr>300 g stock<\/nobr> instead of water in <nobr>step 1.<\/nobr> Finally you can omit the instant dashi powder altogether; the dish will have a more subtle egg flavour that is also very pleasant.","Steam in any heat-resistant cups or small bowls of similar size. If your dishes are a different size or they are not ceramic, you may have to adjust the cooking time.
