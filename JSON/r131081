The texture improves after one day.","If transporting the cake, it is better to refrigerate it first. It will set to a firm consistency, making it easy to slice.","To make a cake with vanilla cookie layers, simply omit the dark chocolate in the cookie recipe. The texture will not change, and the dough will still work well."],"basicInfo":["medium","30m","1h 15m","20 slices"]}
