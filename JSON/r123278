If you prefer, you can use dried blueberries or dried cherries instead of the cranberries.","You might like to use honey instead of the rice malt syrup, however, you will get a sweeter result. You can also use half rice malt syrup and half maple syrup.","Store these Florentines in a sealable container in the refrigerator.
