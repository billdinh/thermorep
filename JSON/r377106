Also, be aware that bliss balls can be a choking hazard so if preparing these for younger children cut them up as needed.","You can store these bliss balls in a sealable container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.","Almonds are thought to be a galactagogue (a food that can help increase breastmilk supply), but the research is still inconclusive and individual results vary. If you're breastfeeding, you may find that they help with your milk supply - just be sure to drink plenty of water too.","These are a great alternative to a store-bought chocolate treat. I like to keep serving sizes small for bliss balls."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","1h 10m","20 portions"]}
