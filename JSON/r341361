To press tofu, use a tofu press or line a plate with paper towels. Place tofu block on the paper towels and cover with another layer of paper towel. Place a plate or a cutting board on top of the paper towels, then place heavy weights (books or cans) on top. Set aside for several hours until liquid has been pressed out.","We recommend using organic tofu whenever possible.","If you prefer a crisper tofu, you could fry tofu instead of steaming it. While vegetables are steaming, place a large frying pan over medium heat and add oil. Add tofu pieces and toss to coat in the oil. Fry until browned (approx. 5 minutes), then serve with rice and vegetables.","Be sure to check the label of your tamari and hoisin sauce, as not all brands are gluten free."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","50m","4 portions"]}
