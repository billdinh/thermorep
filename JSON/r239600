Best made in the summer months when peaches are in season, the fresh fruit is stuffed with crushed homemade amaretti biscuit then baked until the fruit is juicy and the topping is crispy. Accompanied by the rich Italian classic, zabaglione, a custard made with egg yolks, sugar and Marsala wine, this dessert is a triumph."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","1h 20m","4 portions"]}
