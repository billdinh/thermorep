Stone fruit, such as peaches and plums, can be used in a cobbler as well. When using stone fruit, peel fruit, remove the pit and slice into wedges. Toss in sugar and allow to macerate for 30 minutes before draining the fruit to use. Whisk a few ounces of the liquid to create a slurry with the corn starch. Baking time for stone fruit may need reducing to 10-15 minutes.","Use wet hands when forming dough balls to prevent them from sticking to your hands.","Serve blueberry cobbler warm with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","1h","8 portions"]}
