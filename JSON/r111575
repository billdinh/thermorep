Originating in Gujarat, it is traditionally made with rice and lentils but this quick version uses semolina and is known in the west as ‘instant’ dhokla.","Using wooden skewers in the base of the Varoma dish creates a trivet for the cake tin to stand on. This enables the steam to circulate evenly around the tin without any obstructions.","Serve with pickles or chutneys and salad or as an accompaniment to curries.","Can be served warm or at room temperature."],"basicInfo":["easy","5m","30m","10 portions"]}
