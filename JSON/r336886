Roll each piece of dough with a rolling pin into an elongated shape and feed through the pasta machine while guiding the dough. Run dough through pasta machine with rollers set on most open setting; fold dough into thirds and roll it back through the pasta maker. If dough sticks, coat with a little more flour. Fold and roll the dough three more times on this setting. Adjust rollers to the next level of thinness and guide dough back through the machine with the back of your hand, repeating the process until dough is approximately 1\/16 inch thick. Keep remaining dough covered to prevent from drying out. Repeat with remaining dough. Immediately cut sheets into lasagna noodles (4 in. x 13 in.).
