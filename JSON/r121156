I like to prepare them when I have friends around, serve the steamed buns either pre-assembled in the centre of the table or place all the components in dishes and each person can assemble their own. Alternatively, they are fantastic for parties. The wasabi mayonnaise makes a bit more than needed; keep the remaining wasabi mayo in a container in the fridge for up to three days and use in sandwiches or as a dip with prawn crackers and crudités."],"basicInfo":["advanced","50m","2h 50m","16 pieces"]}
