Like many spiced dishes, you may find this tastes better reheated the day after it’s been prepared, when the flavours have had more time to develop. It is a great, economical accompaniment to dry curries and rice to complete a meal. Dal is eaten very widely in India and is a good source of protein."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","9h 5m","6 portions"]}
