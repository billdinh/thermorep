For instance, add chopped fresh chillies, or replace green beans with green peas. And don’t be alarmed by the amount of garlic: once cooked, it gives the sauce a mellow, subtle flavour.","If your shallow bowl is <b>14 cm<b> or larger, ensure the holes of the Varoma dish are not blocked by using a steaming rack, <b>2 small<b> chopsticks or a wooden chopstick broken in two to support the shallow bowl off the bottom of the Varoma dish.","Mung bean vermicelli are commonly used for this dish, however rice vermicelli also work well.","To curl the spring onions, cut in <b>10 cm<b> lengths and then lengthwise in thin strips (julienne), place in a bowl of cold water with a few ice cubes, and chill approx. <b>20-30 minutes<b> until curled.","If the raw prawns are small <b>(6-7 cm)<b> they can be steamed from frozen."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","1h 15m","4 portions"]}
