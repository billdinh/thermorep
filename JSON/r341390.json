To press tofu, use a tofu press or line a plate with paper towels. Place tofu block on the paper towels and cover with another layer of paper towel. Place a plate or a cutting board on top of the paper towels, then place heavy weights (books or cans) on top. Set aside for several hours until liquid has been pressed out.","We recommend using organic tofu whenever possible.","To cook rice or quinoa, refer to the Boiled rice recipe in <i>The Basic Cookbook<\/i>. If cooking quinoa, be sure to rinse it before cooking to remove any bitterness."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","30m","4 portions"]}
