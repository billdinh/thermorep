Similar to a calzone but much smaller in shape, panzerotti were originally filled with a mixture of cheese and cooked meat, then deep-fried in lard and eaten hot. Today, this traditional preparation has changed very little. Ours are filled with ricotta cheese and sausage meat and make a moreish appetiser or snack with drinks.","Lightly grease cling film to prevent it from sticking to the dough during the resting and leavening stages.","Cover the remaining dough with cling film (or a damp cloth) during assembly to prevent the surface of the dough from drying out.","If preferred, cook the panzerotti in a preheated oven at 200°C for <nobr>20-30 minutes.<\/nobr>"],"basicInfo":["medium","20m","2h","8 portions"]}
