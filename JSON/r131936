If doing this, omit the soy sauce until just before cooking. Soy sauce will change the texture of the fish if left to marinate for too long.","Broccoli couscous is very popular with young and old alike, and a fun way of eating this nutritious vegetable."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","25m","4 portions"]}
