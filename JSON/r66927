Freeze dough partially rolled out for faster defrosting in the refrigerator.","To blind bake a tart crust, use a rolling pin to roll out pastry onto a ThermoMat or lightly floured work surface. Line a greased quiche or tart tin with the pastry and prick with a fork to avoid air bubbles. Line pastry with baking paper and fill with pie weights (e.g. rice, beans) before baking in a preheated oven (180°C) for 15 minutes. Remove baking paper and pie weights and bake for a further 5 minutes or until golden brown."],"basicInfo":["easy","5m","5m","1 total recipe"]}
