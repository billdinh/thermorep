This humble dish is believed to have been invented by mistake, when leftover ravioli filling was reformed into dumplings by a resourceful chef. With spinach giving them a distinctive green colouring, the dumplings are served coated in a sage butter and eaten as part of an antipasti spread, or covered with a rich tomato sauce and enjoyed as a hearty main meal.","To make this recipe suitable for vegetarians, substitute the Parmesan cheese for a vegetarian hard cheese."],"basicInfo":["medium","35m","45m","40 pieces"]}
