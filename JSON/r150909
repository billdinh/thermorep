Merguez are fresh, spicy sausages made from mutton and\/or beef, and are typical of the region. You can replace them with any other spicy sausage, or omit them altogether. For a more traditional flavour, replace the cinnamon and ginger with 2 Tbsp ras-el-hanout, a North African spice blend that can contain up to 40 ingredients.<\/i>","The bone in the lamb shoulder meat adds flavour.
