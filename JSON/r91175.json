A cold work surface (marble or stone) and a cool room temperature are helpful. If at any time during the process the dough feels warm, place into the freezer for 5 minutes before rolling out again. To prevent the dough from sticking to the work surface, whenever necessary use a light dusting of flour, or roll dough between two sheets of parchment.","Puff pastry dough freezes very well before baking. Defrost in the refrigerator before using. Partially rolling out the dough before freezing allows for faster defrosting.","Once baked, pastry keeps well for up to 15 days stored in a sealed container in a cool dry place.","Replace water with very cold white wine."],"basicInfo":["medium","20m","1h 20m","1"]}
