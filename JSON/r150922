The thyme butter sauce melts on its own in the Varoma while the green bean bundles and potatoes steam. You could also serve this dish as a lighter meal on its own, with a simple salad.<\/i>","For a vegetarian version, omit bacon and use spring onions or chives to tie the green bean bundles.<br>- Serve a cream and chive sauce drizzled over the potatoes instead of the thyme butter.<br>- Add some chopped garlic to the thyme butter before steaming."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","50m","4 portions"]}
