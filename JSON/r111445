It is a staple of Indian households where it is frequently used as a condiment (when thinned and flavoured), as a snack, and as an accompaniment to starters and main dishes. Also, widely used in other cuisines including Thai and Mexican, tamarind paste can be made for a fraction of the cost of buying it, and it is much more satisfying knowing you have made it yourself in your Thermomix."],"basicInfo":["easy","5m","15m","1 total recipe"]}
