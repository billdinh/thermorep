It simply derives its natural sweetness from the dates and banana. Remember that riper bananas are naturally sweeter, so try not to use unripe banana.","Like cornflour, arrowroot flour can be used to thicken custards and sauces. Arrowroot is a good option if you wish to avoid genetically modified cornflour (although you can buy GMO-free cornflour). Just be sure to buy a pure, preservative free product.","When buying desiccated coconut, be sure to source one that's preservative free (most organic brands are suitable).","You can serve this custard warm or cold. You can store it in a sealable container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days."],"basicInfo":["easy","5m","15m","1"]}
