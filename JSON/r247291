In other parts of Italy, <i>pizza bianca<\/i> (white pizza) is just that - a pizza without tomato sauce. Our version showcases two popular Italian cheeses, Fontina and mozzarella, as well as artichokes and white truffle oil. Truffles are a traditional product of Tuscany where they are used in everything from scrambled eggs to risotto. They are known as one of the most luxurious foods in the world and fetch a hefty price at market.
