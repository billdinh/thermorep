It’s preferable to use a brand of peanut butter with no added salt or sugar (or, better still, make your own). If your peanut butter does have added sugar, you might like to cut the syrup quantity by half. To make a thinner frosting, add 1-2 tbsp of milk when adding syrup in frosting.","If you prefer, you can spread the icing over the cupcakes with a small spatula, instead of piping it."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","1h","12 portions"]}
