Carefully remove baking paper lining, then make an incision about 1 cm in from the short edge, being careful not to cut through the sponge - this makes it easier to roll up. Gently roll up sponge, with sugar coated paper inside. Cover with a damp tea towel then set aside to cool."}],"hintsAndTricks":["A cream only filling can also be used.
