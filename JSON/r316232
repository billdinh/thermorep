The dish dates back to the days of aristocracy in Dubrovnik when the wealthy would, after having eaten all the best meat, mix the remaining meat sauce with macaroni for their servants on feast days and at celebrations. Simple to make and, more importantly tasty to eat, the dish is ever popular."],"basicInfo":["easy","25m","2h 15m","4 portions"]}
