An added benefit is that you can make them up to two days in advance and have them ready in the fridge as an easy and elegant dessert.<\/i>","Instead of diced mango, serve cheesecakes with mango coulis: place <b>250 g fresh<b> mango, cut in pieces, <b>75 g sugar<b> and <b>15 g lime<b> (or lemon) juice in mixing bowl and blend <b><strong>30 sec\/speed 5-10,<\/strong><b> <strong>increasing speed gradually.<\/strong> Scrape down sides of mixing bowl with spatula.

Frozen mango can be used as well; defrost before dicing.","These cheesecakes can be steamed in other small dishes or containers, such as dariole moulds, espresso cups, glasses, verrines or silicone muffin moulds, provided they are heatproof. Steaming time may need increasing by <b>5-10 minutes<b> if the containers are larger than those recommended in the recipe. If using ramekins or moulds no taller than <b>4 cm,<b> place them in both the Varoma dish and tray as described in the recipe.
