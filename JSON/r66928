Place onto a baking tray lined with baking paper. Bake for 10 - 12 minutes (180°C) or until golden. Allow to cool on a wire rack before decorating or dusting with icing sugar to serve.","Instead of rolling out dough with a rolling pin, you can shape it into a log. For biscuits, roll the log until it is round then slice into round slices (5 mm thick). For a tart case, make a flatter log, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm enough to cut. Cut dough into long thin slices (5 mm thick). Place slices into tart tin so they are slightly overlapping and press down with fingers to fill any cracks.
