The spice seeds pop and sizzle bringing out their intense flavour and aroma. For this recipe, a tarka made from fried onions, mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds added to hot oil and stirred in just before serving would work well.","This pulse-based vegetable soup originates from south India and is often served with rice or dosas, but it makes an excellent starter or accompaniment to an Indian spread of curries and rice.
