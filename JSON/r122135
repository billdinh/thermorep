Cut down on the sweetness by making your own with minimal sugar such as Berry chia jam (please refer to the recipe on this recipe chip) or try to find a brand with a higher fruit content. Some quality jams are available with 70 per cent fruit - check the label so you know what you‘re getting.","If you’re watching calories, you’re best to choose (freshly) whipped cream over double cream. It has almost one-third of the calories and one-third of the fat of the same volume of double cream.","These cakes are best eaten fresh on the day they’re made."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","1h","12 portions"]}
