Please refer to <i>The Basic Cookbook<\/i> for timings for both soft and hard boiled eggs. If you prefer soft boiled eggs, take care when peeling soft boiled eggs.","Be sure to use a soft cream cheese for the dressing. Using a firm cream cheese will make dressing too thick and dressing may not combine properly. If needed, add more water for a thinner consistency if desired."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","30m","6 portions"]}
