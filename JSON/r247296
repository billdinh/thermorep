Our version of this delicious dish features aubergines that are sliced and then steamed in the Varoma. Once cooked, the aubergines are layered with a flavourful tomato sauce and plenty of mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan, before being baked until hot and bubbling. Serve accompanied with a green salad."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","1h","6 portions"]}
