As such, the name (in Portuguese) indicates vinegar and garlic, and uses chillies that were introduced to Goa by the Portuguese. It also uses garam masala which adds further heat. Though we have made it here with the authentic pork, it often uses chicken or lamb so feel free to substitute it with a meat of your choice.","Serve with yoghurt or raita on the side to counteract the heat from the curry.","The pork can be left to marinate overnight for even greater depth of flavour."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","4h","6 portions"]}
