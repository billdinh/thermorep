While there are a number of claims regarding the origins of this rustic dish, the general consensus is that it was cooked by people who preferred to use store-cupboard ingredients rather than shopping for fresh produce at the farmers’ market. Whatever the origins of this traditional sauce, Italians do agree on the ingredients; tomatoes, onions, capers, black olives, anchovies and garlic are all cooked together in olive oil, then ladled over pasta."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","35m","6 portions"]}
