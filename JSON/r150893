For instance, add chopped fresh chillies, or replace green beans with green peas. And don’t be alarmed by the amount of garlic: once cooked, it gives the sauce a mellow, subtle flavour<\/i>.","If your shallow bowl is <b>14 cm<b> or larger, ensure the holes of the Varoma dish are not blocked by using a steaming rack, <b>2 small<b> chopsticks or a wooden chopstick broken in two to support the shallow bowl off the bottom of the Varoma dish.<br>- Mung bean vermicelli are commonly used for this dish, however rice vermicelli also work well.<br>- To curl spring onions, cut in <b>10 cm<b> lengths and then lengthwise in thin strips (julienne), place in a bowl of cold water with a few ice cubes, and chill approx. <b>20-30 minutes<b> until curled.<br>- If raw prawns are small <b>(6-7 cm)<b> they can be steamed from frozen."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","1h 15m","4 portions"]}
