The fresh sweet taste of corn with a zesty orange flavouring is a surprising yet pleasing complement to the marinated fish. If fresh corn is not in season, use frozen or canned corn kernels. As for the fish, any white freshwater fish will give great results in this recipe.<\/i>","Fish sauce and sesame oil are available in the Asian section of supermarkets or in Asian grocery stores and some supermarkets. <br>- If you’re in a hurry, omit marinating the fish: place the fish and marinade ingredients directly onto the Varoma tray lined with baking paper.<br>- To cut the kernels off a fresh corn cob, use a sharp knife to slice from top to bottom, avoiding the cob itself as much as possible. Alternatively use a corn stripper.","Use any type of freshwater fish with firm white flesh. Adjust steaming time after draining fish fillets according to the texture and thickness of the fish fillets."],"basicInfo":["easy","45m","1h 5m","4 portions"]}
