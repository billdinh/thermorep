When added to fondant it makes a paste firm enough to hold its shape. If modelling paste is not holding it's shape, add a very small amount of additional tylose. Use sparingly, as too much will dry out your paste.","If you are not using Buttercream icing immediately, place into the refrigerator until ready to use. Before using, bring back to room temperature or stir until softened enough to pipe.","Liquid food colouring may affect the texture of your fondant and modelling paste; add sifted icing sugar as needed. Once your fondant or modelling paste is coloured, try to avoid excess use of icing sugar when rolling or modelling as this will leave white marks. We recommend natural food colouring gel when possible.","Always keep modelling paste wrapped in plastic wrap inside a snaplock bag since it dries out quickly. Work quickly with modelling paste and keep it covered while working with it.","If your modelling paste cracks and feels dry, very firm or crumbly, knead in a few drops of glycerine or a few drops of cooled boiled water into the paste to soften it and make it more elastic. This will help avoid cracks in the finished product. You can also rub some Copha (white vegetable shortening) onto your palms and work surface and continue to knead.","Sugar glue can be purchased from cake decorating shops or online.","Cupcakes can be made up to 5 days in advance.
