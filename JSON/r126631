They should then still be solid, but no longer entirely frozen.","If using fresh salmon, cut the fillets into pieces (3-4 cm), lay them flat on a board or in a freezer bag, and allow to freeze.","If you do not have any fresh dill, use 1½ tsp frozen or dried dill.","Serving suggestion: toast burger rolls in oven or toaster so they are nice and crisp. Spread e.g. mayonnaise or any dip of your choice on two roll halves, place salmon burger on bottom half of roll, add lettuce, coleslaw or sliced vegetables to taste, place top half of roll on top and serve."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","25m","4 pieces"]}
