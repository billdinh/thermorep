They give a fresh exotic flavour to this not overly-sweet dessert and steaming provides the dreamy texture. An added benefit is that you can make them up to 2 days ahead and have them ready in the fridge as an easy and elegant dessert. However, make sure the family knows you are saving them, otherwise they might well disappear as they are quite irresistible!","Instead of diced mango serve the cheesecakes with mango coulis: place <b>250 g fresh<b> mango, cut into pieces, <b>75 g sugar<b> and <b>15 g lime<b> (or lemon) juice into mixing bowl and blend <b>30 sec\/speed 5-10,<b> <b>increasing speed gradually from speed 5 to speed 10..<b> Scrape down sides of mixing bowl with spatula.

The steaming time may have to be increased by <b>5-10 minutes<b> if the containers are larger than those recommended in the recipe.
