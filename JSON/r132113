It has a strong odour, but the aroma softens as it cooks, and tastes similar to onion and garlic, enhancing the flavour of savoury dishes. It helps reduce flatulence and constipation, and reduces the growth of microflora in the gut. A little goes a long way, so only a small amount is needed. Asafoetida can be found in Indian grocers or online.","To make your own ghee, garlic paste, ginger paste and garam masala, please refer to the recipes on this recipe chip.","You can serve this with rice, bread, chutney or your favourite side.
