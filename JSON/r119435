If freezing, allow them to cool completely, then place into snaplock bags in the freezer. Reheat frozen or thawed puffs in a moderate oven (180°C).","If you have a dehydrator, make puffs extra crisp by placing cooled puffs in the dehydrator for 30 minutes at 50°C just before piping in filling and serving. This can also be done in a low oven (50°C), with the door slightly ajar."],"basicInfo":["medium","30m","2h 30m","32 portions"]}
