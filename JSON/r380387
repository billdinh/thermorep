It's an antioxidant and has been found to have anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects. It's of particular interest to scientists for its potential role in warding off neurological disease and for its possible anticancer and antidiabetic potential. I like to include it in baby purées for some flavour training. If your child has tasted turmeric in their early years they are far more likely to accept the flavour as they get older."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","45m","1"]}
