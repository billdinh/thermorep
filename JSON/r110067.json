Do not stir, but occasionally swirl the saucepan until sugar becomes a fairly dark amber. At this point, <b>very carefully<b> pour in approx. 3.5 oz hot water (it will bubble up and spatter). Stir over medium heat until all caramel dissolves and thickens slightly. This caramel will keep for weeks refrigerated in a sealed jar."],"basicInfo":["medium","10m","6h","6 portions"]}
