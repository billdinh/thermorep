Wash before use if the fruit is not going to be peeled.","To ensure preservation, clean jam jars thoroughly in hot soapy water. Rinse by pouring boiling water over them. Prepare for filling by placing clean jars in a baking pan and heat in oven (212°F) until required. Pour jam into jars while jars are still warm.","Setting point test: place a saucer into the freezer (5-10 min.). Place 1 tsp jam onto the chilled saucer. When jam on saucer is cool, push it with your finger. If the jam wrinkles, it is ready. If not, boil jam for a further 2 minutes, then test again.","Adjust cooking time according to the consistency you prefer: longer cooking time results in thicker jam.","Depending on the fruit, the jam may bubble up slightly onto the Varoma. If this happens, reduce temperature to 212°F or even to 195°F and extend cooking time as needed.","<strong>For raspberry jam<\/strong>: replace strawberries with 17 oz raspberries. Reduce cooking time to 8-10 minutes according to desired consistency.","<strong>For mixed berries jam<\/strong>: use a total of 9 oz strawberries and 9 oz raspberries. Reduce cooking time to 25-30 minutes."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","1h 5m","1"]}
