Fish and shellfish should marinate for 30-60 minutes; any longer and the flesh may start to “cook” and go mushy.","Serve with rice, beans and plenty of lime wedges.","The sauce and shredded cabbage can be made ahead and stored in the fridge until needed. Store sauce in an airtight jar. For the cabbage, place in a bowl and cover with a wet paper towel to prevent from drying out."],"basicInfo":["easy","25m","45m","6 portions"]}
