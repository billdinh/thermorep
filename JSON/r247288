It is especially prevalent in dishes from the Northern regions. This is a country-style dish where the citrus flavours, married with thyme and contrasted with salty olives, are paired beautifully with delicate rabbit flesh. Butchers or farmers’ markets here in the UK and Ireland typically sell rabbit. Ask them to bone it for you."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","1h 30m","4 portions"]}
