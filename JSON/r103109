Place 1 tablespoon samosa filling at top of each pastry strip. Fold the top left corner of the pastry strip diagonally to the right, enclosing the filling and forming a triangle. Fold again (folding down) along the bottom crease of the triangle. Keep folding, creating triangles, to the bottom of the strip. Using your fingertips, dampen remaining pastry edge with water, then fold over to close and seal samosa. Set aside on lined tray and cover with kitchen towel (see Tips). Repeat with remaining pastry strips and samosa filling to create 24 samosas total.","Line a large plate with paper towel and set aside. Place a large saucepan over high heat and add oil. Heat oil to 170°C (see Tips).
