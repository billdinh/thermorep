They have a characteristic texture being soft inside with crunchy edges, as well as a perfectly round shape. Do not be discouraged by the possible difficulties with this recipe and know that, even if the finished results are not perfect to look at, they will be delicious to eat!","This recipe asks for egg whites that have been separated 1 or 2 days before. Alternatively, you can use frozen egg whites, thawed completely before use.","To get the perfect shape, circles can be drawn onto the underside of the baking paper that the macarons will be piped onto.","Keep the piping bag at a 45° angle and position the tip in the middle of the circle. Put pressure on the piping bag constantly, until the circle is filled. This method will give the best results, with the macaroons all equal in diameter.","The macaron shells can be prepared in advance and stored for a week in an airtight container. Once filled, store in the fridge and eat within a few days. Alternatively, they can be frozen. Before serving, allow to thaw at room temperature for half an hour.","Remove from fridge 30 minutes before serving.<br>"],"basicInfo":["advanced","45m","25h 30m","40 pieces"]}
