You can also use activated or roasted hazelnuts instead of raw, if preferred.","You can make your own buckwheat flour in your Thermomix from scratch. Place 250 g raw buckwheat groats into your mixing bowl and mill <strong>2 min\/speed 10<\/strong>, until a fine, flour-like consistency is achieved.","If you’re making these cupcakes for someone with a wheat intolerance, then choose a gluten-free brand of baking powder. All the remaining ingredients are gluten free.","You can use homemade or store-bought hazelnut chocolate spread for this recipe. Homemade spread is the much healthier option. Store-bought spreads tend to be sweeter, so you’re unlikely to need the stevia extract powder in the cupcake mixture if using.","The avocado in the icing adds some green raw goodness to these cupcakes, with a boost of Vitamin C, folate, Vitamin K, Vitamin E, fibre and potassium. The flavour is quite subtle - it is a great way to get some extra green into your day."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","1h","12 portions"]}
