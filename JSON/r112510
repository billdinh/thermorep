Check potatoes are just cooked in step 2 by inserting a sharp knife, and prolong cooking time if necessary.","This is a chunky, quite dry, vegetable curry. Waxy potatoes like Charlotte are recommended, and it is best if they are scrubbed but not peeled. Peeling them, cutting them smaller, or using other potato varieties may produce a different result.","Potatoes and cauliflower may sound like humble vegetables, but they take on all the flavour and vibrancy of their spice partners in this chunky, dry vegetable curry. This classic everyday dish also makes an excellent accompaniment to your favourite curries – or serve it with an egg on top for breakfast!"],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","50m","4 portions"]}
