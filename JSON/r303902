By using dehydrated, activated cashews, it will increase the shelf life of your dip to 12 days when dip is covered with oil.","Probiotics are live micro-organisms that can support digestive health and immune function, including improving resilience to infections and improving digestion of lactose. You can find them in the refrigerated section of most chemists and health food stores. We recommend purchasing chilled probiotics, to ensure the organisms are most effective.","To avoid the lid popping off during fermentation, do not fill jars more than three-quarters full. When filling the jars, take care not to get any dip on the sides of the jar as if left exposed (not covered by oil), it may get mouldy and spoil the dip.","In colder climates, dip may take up to 4 days to ferment."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","25h","1"]}
