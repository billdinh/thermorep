For a child who’s happy with flecks of green, try using different herbs from time to time, such as coriander or chives.","If you don’t have time to do a three-layered crumb, you can just go straight to the quinoa crumb and skip the flour and egg mixture.","If gluten free is not needed, you can replace the gluten free plain flour with plain flour in this recipe.","Add a little sea salt to taste for adults and older children. However, there is salt in the tamari and parmesan, so go easy.","Your child might like these served with a homemade mayonnaise, avocado purée or tomato salsa. Feel free to use whichever is their preferred dip."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","50m","20 portions"]}
