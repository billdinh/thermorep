Cut the asparagus into lengths that your baby can easily hold.","<b>Toddler’s serve<b>: serve as is, with asparagus cut into smaller lengths.","Fish roe is gaining recognition as an excellent source of omega-3 fats (DHA) in ‘phospholipid’ form, which research suggests might be the most bioavailable form. DHA is linked to improved brain function and a lower dementia risk so it’s a nutrient I like my whole family to have regularly. I keep a jar of roe in the fridge and use it in place of a fish oil supplement. You can find ocean trout roe at specialty food stores, selected fishmongers and online.","Using asparagus dippers, rather than toast, adds a boost of green to your morning. Asparagus is also a particularly good choice for gut health – it has high levels of inulin, a special kind of ‘prebiotic’ that encourages the growth of good bacteria in your gut.","The eggs will continue to firm from their residual heat when they are set aside, so if you crack them straight after removing them from the mixing bowl, they may not be cooked through. If using straight away, you may wish to cook them for an extra 30-60 seconds. Furthermore, egg cooking times can vary depending on the size of your eggs and whether they have been brought to room temperature before cooking. For food safety, cook the eggs at least until the whites are cooked through and the yolks have started to thicken.","You can store any leftover Hollandaise sauce in a sealable container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days; simply reheat before serving."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","40m","4 portions"]}
