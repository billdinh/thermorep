It is a concentrated product of date, cane juice, or palm sap without separation of the molasses and crystals and is a healthier way to sweeten your foods. It may also act as a digestive aid.","To make your own ghee and Tamarind paste, please refer to the recipes on this recipe chip.","Rasam is full of health benefits and is an integral part of south Indian meals and is more like a soup. It is often eaten in small amounts after meals to help aid digestion and to help with colds and flu. It can be eaten over plain rice, as a soup or added to main meals.
