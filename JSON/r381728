Exposure to a variety of tastes is particularly crucial in the first year of life when babies are typically more accepting of unfamiliar tastes.","You can replace the natural yoghurt with kefir milk in this recipe.","Fruit purées like this one also make a lovely addition to your baby's porridge or rice cereal if you're serving one. Just be sure to give your baby plenty of iron-rich, savoury purées too. Fruit is nutritious and it's important that your baby develops a liking for various fruit flavours, but offering less sweet options is crucial too."],"basicInfo":["easy","5m","25m","1"]}
