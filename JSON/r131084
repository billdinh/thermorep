Place one sponge bottom half on a serving plate, spread 2 tbsp reserved salted caramel and a quarter of reserved cream on top. Put cream on the next sponge bottom and repeat this step two more times, then place the last layer of cake on top. Spread the remaining cream over the top of the cake, cover the surface of the cream with small drops of salted caramel and then drag a wet fork through the caramel and cream to create waves. Refrigerate until ready to serve. "}],"hintsAndTricks":["Liquid caramel is a useful flavouring to have in the kitchen. It is available online or at any good delicatessen or supermarket.","Use the built-in Thermomix scales to measure out the exact quantity of cake batter for each cake tin. At the end of the recipe, turn scales on, lift out the mixing bowl and pour some cake batter into the prepared tin. You need to pour 450 g into each tin. When you return the mixing bowl to the base, it will show a minus figure indicating the weight removed (- 450 g).","Cutting the cake horizontally is easy - you can either use a long knife, or this method: Score a line around the outside of the cake as a guide, keeping the line 1 cm from the table all the way around. Slide a string into the cut and pull through the cake <strong><\/strong> to make two layers."],"basicInfo":["medium","1h","2h 40m","12 slices"]}
