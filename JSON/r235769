He created the bread in response to the popularity of French baguettes and named it ciabatta (slipper) as the shape reminded him of his wife’s slippers! Ciabatta bread is made with a biga, a type of pre-fermentation often used in Italian baking that creates a light, open texture with holes. This ciabatta pizza is topped with flavourful San Marzano tomatoes and pieces of sweet lobster, before being drizzled with garlic butter for a truly luxurious finish.","This recipe will work with cooked or uncooked lobster meat."],"basicInfo":["easy","35m","11h","4 portions"]}
