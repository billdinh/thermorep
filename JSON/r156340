If not, scrub them well under running water and pull off their “beards”. They will be ready for steaming by the time the onions are sautéed, and will release their juices into the delicious cream sauce – serve with plenty of good bread for soaking it up.<\/i>"],"basicInfo":["easy","25m","45m","4 portions"]}
