Using oiled hands, cut each log into 10 slices (approx. 1 cm). Keep dough covered with plastic wrap while making dumplings to prevent it from drying out. Flatten each slice with the palm of your hand into a disc. Using a rolling pin, roll out each disc into a thin circle (2 mm thickness, 10 cm diameter), dusting with a little wheat starch as needed to prevent dough from sticking. Place 1 heaped teaspoon of the filling in the centre of each disc. Seal dumplings by by folding in half, then pinching and pleating the edges to seal, trimming away any excess dough, if needed. Arrange a dumpling on each carrot slice."},{"content":"Place water into mixing bowl. Place Varoma in position, secure Varoma lid and steam <b>12 min\/Varoma\/speed 1<b>.
