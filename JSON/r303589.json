When you remove the ball from the water, it will flatten like a pancake after a few moments in your hand. If the mixture does not form the ball, cook for a further 2 minutes. If this stage is not reached, the fudge will not set enough to be cut.","You can store fudge in the refrigerator for up to 1 week."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","3h 10m","24 portions"]}
