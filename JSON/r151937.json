Brush dough with some melted butter, then lift over backs of your hands and gently stretch it with your knuckles towards table edges. Move around the edge of the dough and keep stretching slowly and carefully toward and finally over the table edges, until dough is very large, thin and transparent. Use scissors to cut off thick edges of dough. If holes appear while stretching, pinch them together lightly (small holes will not be visible after rolling the strudel)."},{"content":"Brush entire dough surface with more melted butter, sprinkle reserved breadcrumb and hazelnut mixture in a wide band along shortest edge of the pastry, leaving a few cm of dough uncovered along the edge, then top the crumb mixture with apple filling, forming a narrower band than the breadcrumb mixture.

Roll the strudel as described in the recipe, then cut through the channel to form two strudels, pinching the ends of each strudel shut.","Serve with vanilla sauce, vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.","The breadcrumb and hazelnut mixture traps juices from the apples and keeps the strudel crust crisp. Instead of using both, you can use all breadcrumbs or all hazelnuts.","Before placing apples on breadcrumb mixture, check whether they have released a lot of juice. For a drier filling, discard part of the juice.","Dough can be prepared a day or two in advance and stored in the fridge.","Instead of two tea towels, you can use a large tablecloth to roll the strudel."],"basicInfo":["advanced","45m","1h 45m","12 portions"]}
