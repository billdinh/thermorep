It originated in the Emilia-Romagna region in Northern Italy and dates back to the 15th century. Wider, thicker pasta shapes like tagliatelle work well when paired with thick sauces. To showcase this, we’ve created a luxurious pasta dish that features earthy mushrooms stirred through a rich Parmesan cream sauce, finished with the unmistakably heady aroma of white truffle oil.","The dried tagliatelle in this recipe can be replaced with homemade or fresh shop-bought pasta, if preferred.","To make this recipe suitable for vegetarians, substitute the Parmesan cheese for a vegetarian hard cheese.","Substitute the tagliatelle with any other variety of long, dried pasta such as pappardelle or spaghetti."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","55m","4 portions"]}
