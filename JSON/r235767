Spelt flour is growing in popularity as a healthier alternative to refined white flour. It’s lower in gluten and gives a crunchy texture to a pizza crust. The toppings on this pizza are also lighter, with shredded kale acting as the base combined with salty feta cheese and mozzarella. The finishing touch? Two eggs are cracked into each half of the pizzas and baked for a few minutes, leaving the runny yolks free to ooze into every bite once the pizzas are cut.","Lightly grease cling film to prevent it from sticking to the dough during the resting and leavening stages.","There is no need to line non-stick baking trays."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","1h 20m","4 portions"]}
