Historically it was made from grains such as farro and millet, while the classic yellow polenta we know today came about with the introduction of corn in the 16th century. In this recipe, the flavoured, cooked polenta is topped with earthy porcini mushrooms and Gorgonzola cheese, then cut into bite-sized pieces for canapés or antipasti.","Dip a soft spatula in hot water and use to flatten and smooth polenta out in the tins.","To make this recipe suitable for vegetarians, substitute the Parmesan cheese for a vegetarian hard cheese and Gorgonzola for a vegetarian blue cheese."],"basicInfo":["easy","5m","50m","32 pieces"]}
