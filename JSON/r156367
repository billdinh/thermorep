No problem! Steaming produces surprisingly tender cakes, and the gentle heat allows you to melt chocolate for glazing at the same time as the cake steams. Different types of tins or bowls can be used for steaming cakes, as the temperature is lower than in an oven. Have a look at the variations to see the many ways this recipe can be adapted to your preferences.<\/i>","Instead of the chocolate glaze you can dust the cake with icing sugar, cover it with icing or leave it plain.
