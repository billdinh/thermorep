Place bowl with melted chocolate on mixing bowl lid and stir with spatula for 2-5 seconds, as needed to keep chocolate tempered.","For best results: look for chocolate with high cocoa solids. Cocoa or some derivative, such as cocoa butter should be the primary ingredient. Quality chocolate will have a matte gloss finish and smooth texture that is free of discoloration. Dark chocolate should make a snapping sound when broken without crumbling while white and milk chocolate should bend rather than snap.","Once chocolate is tempered, place a kitchen towel under bowl to help keep it in place while you stir and dip.","If a candy mold is unavailable: dust a baking pan (9 in. x 9 in.) with 1 oz corn starch and 1 oz confectioners sugar and proceed with recipe. Before melting chocolate, remove from freezer and allow to sit out a few minutes. Cut mixture into 24 pieces (3 in. x 1½ in.), transfer to prepared baking sheet, return to freezer and proceed with recipe."],"basicInfo":["advanced","45m","2h 30m","16 pieces"]}
