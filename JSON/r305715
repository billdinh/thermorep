The characteristic sponge originally came from using a red cocoa powder, however, red food dye is more commonly used today. We suggest using food colouring gels or pastes as the resulting colour will be deeper and more intense than that achieved from the liquid variety. Finished with an irresistible cream cheese icing, this cake will be a hit with everyone!","Different food colourings have different strengths. Adjust quantity according to preference.","Adding vinegar and buttermilk helps the raising agent, in this instance bicarbonate of soda, work effectively."],"basicInfo":["medium","25m","1h 20m","12 slices"]}
