You can boost the amount of veg (or add legumes) to keep it as a substantial meal.","This recipe works best using pre-cut strips of stir-fry beef (it also saves time). If you decide to cut larger pieces of beef into strips, you may need to adjust cooking time accordingly, depending on size and cut of beef used."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","35m","4 portions"]}
