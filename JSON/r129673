This particular food holiday is about a little more than just a delicious fried ring of dough. National Donut Day was started by the Chicago branch of the Salvation Army in 1938 during the Great Depression as a way to raise funds and honor the “donut lassies” who served donuts at the front lines of World War I. Women of the Salvation Army who baked and served donuts for this effort were referred to as “donut lassies.” In an attempt to lift their spirits and give them a link to home, they served donuts and coffee to soldiers in the trenches of France during the war. With limited resources on the battlefield, they quickly got creative and would even fry donuts in soldiers’ helmets. They had a slogan of “Donuts will win the war!” National Donut Day now falls on the first Friday of every year to honor this service. The Salvation Army branch in Chicago still uses Donut Day as a way to raise funds for their cause.","The <b>peanut butter and jelly sandwich,<b> or <b>PB&amp;J,<b> is a sandwich, popular in North America, that includes a layer of peanut butter and either jelly or jam.","To make your own peanut butter please refer to recipe in <i>The Basic Cookbook or Everyday Cookbook<\/i>."],"basicInfo":["easy","40m","2h 40m","12 portions"]}
