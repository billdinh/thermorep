Whole lemons are pickled in a brine of water, lemon juice and salt to obtain a slightly tart but very lemony flavour. If preserved lemons cannot be found, a small lemon and ½ teaspoon salt may be used instead. The flavour will not be the same, though."],"basicInfo":["medium","30m","1h 35m","4 portions"]}
