This pizza is similar to the <i>quattro stagioni<\/i> (four seasons) with artichokes, mushrooms and olives, but differs in that all ingredients are present in each bite. Combined with a rich tomato sauce brimming with the robust flavour of anchovies, this pizza is a real crowd-pleaser.","For a stronger flavour, in <nobr>step 6<\/nobr>, place anchovies and <nobr>20 g<\/nobr> extra virgin olive oil in mixing bowl, chop <strong><nobr>4 sec\/speed 8<\/nobr><\/strong> then cook <strong><nobr>3 min\/100°C\/speed 1,<\/nobr><\/strong> before adding tomatoes.
