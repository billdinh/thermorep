Combined with a rich tomato sauce brimming with the robust flavour of anchovies, this pizza is a real crowd-pleaser.","For a stronger flavour, in <b>step 6<b>, place anchovies and <b>20 g<b> extra virgin olive oil in mixing bowl, chop <b>4 sec\/speed 8<b> then cook <b>3 min\/100°C\/speed 1,<b> before adding tomatoes.
