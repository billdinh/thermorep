This pizza is similar to the <i>quattro stagioni<\/i> (four seasons) with artichokes, mushrooms and olives, but differs in that all ingredients are present in each bite. Combined with a rich tomato sauce brimming with the robust flavour of anchovies, this pizza is a real crowd-pleaser.","For a stronger flavour, in <b>step 6<b>, place anchovies and <b>20 g<b> extra virgin olive oil in mixing bowl, chop <strong><b>4 sec\/speed 8<b><\/strong> then cook <strong><b>3 min\/100°C\/speed 1,<b><\/strong> before adding tomatoes. Continue with recipe.","Lightly grease cling film to prevent it from sticking to the dough during the resting and leavening stages."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","1h 35m","3 portions"]}
