The rice mixed with nuts and mushrooms has a crunchy and almost meaty texture. Serve as a satisfying main course or as an impressive side dish.","Choose tomatoes that are large enough to fill, yet small enough to fit under the lid on the Varoma tray <b>(Ø 5-6 cm).<b> The number of tomatoes may vary between eight and twelve depending on their size and shape.","The same mixture can be used to stuff vine leaves. Vine leaves can be bought preserved or fresh. Soak leaves for <b>1 minute<b> in boiling water, then drain and pat dry before filling. To fill vine leaves, you will need only <b>600-650 g tomatoes.<b> Use <b>125 g chopped<b> tomatoes instead of tomato slices in <b>step 3,<b> and remaining chopped tomatoes in <b>step 5<b> instead of reserved tomato pulp and slices. Fill vine leaves in <b>step 4<b> and proceed with the recipe.<br>- Use the same mixture to stuff kale leaves, courgettes, bell peppers, onions, or other vegetables."],"basicInfo":["medium","35m","1h 5m","3 portions"]}
