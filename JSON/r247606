The shapes have a large surface area that thick sauces cling to, making rich cheese or tomato-based sauces a great choice for this pasta type. With this in mind, we’ve created a spicy sausage sauce brimming with the strong flavours of sun-dried tomatoes and olives. With both the sauce and pasta cooked in your Thermomix, this is a simple dish that comes together quickly."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","1h","4 portions"]}
