Activated nuts have been soaked, which kick starts their germination process, and then dehydrated. In general, the benefit of using activated nuts is that activation helps to break down the naturally-occurring phytic acid and improves nutrient absorption and digestibility. However, the cooking of this loaf can affect the full activation benefits, so feel free to use whichever type of almonds you have on hand.","You can use cow's milk, soy or almond milk in this recipe.","Omit salt if serving to young children."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","1h 30m","16 portions"]}
