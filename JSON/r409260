Because of their rapid growth, this is one mineral they're often deficient in.","Liver is one of the best sources of iron and a rich source of vitamin A. However because it is possible to have toxic amounts of vitamin A, you need to watch that your child doesn't regularly eat large quantities of liver. A serve of this pâté a couple of times a week is well within safe levels.","You can use less liver - try 350 g - if your child is new to the flavour. Once they're accepting the taste, you can move to 400 g or even up to 500 g for a stronger flavour again. The natural sweetness of the apple and onion and the creaminess of the butter will help them to accept the taste.","This pâté is delicious for adults, too. It's a much better option than store-bought, which virtually always has preservatives. This recipe has no added salt, which is why I like to use salted butter, so it has just a fraction."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","24h 35m","1"]}
