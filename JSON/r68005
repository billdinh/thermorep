If this happens, reduce temperature to 100°C or even to 90°C as needed.","<strong>Strawberry jam:<\/strong> include 1 apple in the 500 g fruit. The pectin in the apple will help the jam reach setting point faster.","Only use ripe fruit in this recipe.","Setting point test: place a saucer into the freezer (5-10 minutes). Place 1 tsp jam onto the chilled saucer. When jam on saucer is cool, push it with your finger. If the jam wrinkles, it is ready. If not, boil jam for a further 2 minutes, then test again.","To ensure jam preserves; clean jam jars thoroughly in hot soapy water, then dry in a low oven or run them through the dishwasher. Pour jam into jars while jars are still warm and proceed as per recipe.","This is a traditional jam recipe with sugar acting as the only conservation and thickening agent. Thanks to the high sugar content, this jam can be stored in the pantry for several months. Once opened, this jam will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 month."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","55m","1 total recipe"]}
