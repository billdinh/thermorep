Transfer 2-3 large spoonfuls of cabbage (with liquid) into a sealable sterilised 1.5L jar, pressing mixture down firmly with a wooden spoon or muddler to soften cabbage and release liquid (see Tips). Repeat with remaining mixture until jar is full, allowing at least a 3 cm gap at the top of the jar. Mixture must be just covered with liquid (see Tips). Seal jar, place into a bowl (see Tips) and store in a dark place for 1 week to ferment. Transfer jar into refrigerator until ready to serve."}],"hintsAndTricks":["Salt is used to draw the liquid out of the cabbage, and acts as a preservative.","Be sure to use clean utensils and a sterilised jar for preserving to eliminate any unwanted bacteria.","Be sure to push down firmly on the cabbage to release any air pockets and ensure the cabbage is submerged in the liquid - it needs to be covered with liquid for fermentation to take place effectively (do not add water; the cabbage will release enough liquid for fermentation). If needed, place a stone, ceramic or glass weight on top of the cabbage to keep it submerged. Alternatively, reserve 2 of the outer cabbage leaves (well washed) to act as a sealant over the cabbage. Fold the cabbage leaves and press on top of the sauerkraut to keep it under the brine.","Allow room at the top of the jar for the liquid to accumulate. We recommend placing the jar into a bowl to catch any liquid that may overflow out of the jar. Store away from direct sunlight.","Fermenting time will vary depending on the ambient temperature. In cooler weather, it may take longer than 1 week for it to ferment. Cabbage has fermented successfully when cabbage looks \"soft\", almost as if it's been cooked. When ready, it will have a tangy and sour flavour.","You can add other vegetables, such as carrots, fennel, parsnips or red cabbage, to your sauerkraut.","Once opened, you can store your sauerkraut in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. It will keep fermenting in the refrigerator, but at a much slower rate due to the cold temperature.","Sauerkraut is great as a side on its own or can be added to salads, such as the <i>Sauerkraut salad<\/i>, or stews, such as the <i>Hunters' stew<\/i> (please refer to the recipes on this recipe chip).","<strong>Cabbage and beetroot sauerkraut<\/strong>: you can replace 300 g of the cabbage with 300 g raw, peeled beetroot in step 1. Proceed as per recipe."],"basicInfo":["easy","25m","168h 35m","8 portions"]}
