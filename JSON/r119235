Simply serve after cutting into squares and dusting.","If uncoated, marshmallows will last up to 1 week in a sealable container. If coated with chocolate, store in the refrigerator in a sealable container for up to 1 week.","It is best to have the melted chocolate on the thicker side so it doesn't drip too much. If chocolate gets too thick while coating, transfer back into the mixing bowl and re-heat.","This recipe uses Hopper gluten free natural 100s and 1000s sprinkles."],"basicInfo":["easy","40m","25h 40m","35 portions"]}
