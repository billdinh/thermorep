Large parts of central and northern Italy are covered with castagneti (chestnut woods) and historically, chestnuts were an important source of food during the winter. This is reflected in the number of chestnut dishes that are still popular in Italy today. In this torte, the sweetness from the chestnuts goes especially well with the bitter dark chocolate.","Serve with crème fraîche and a dusting of icing sugar.","You can make your own chestnut purée in the Thermomix by blending <b>300 g<b> cooked, peeled chestnuts with <b>40 g<b> water.","To keep the torte completely gluten-free, dust the cake tin with gluten-free flour."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","3h 50m","16 slices"]}
