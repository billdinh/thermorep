The brown, sticky pulp inside the pods is processed to a concentrated paste or purée and sold in jars. The tangy fruit adds an acidic accent to foods and sauces. If you can't find tamarind paste, use the same quantity of lime or lemon juice instead.","<i>French green<\/i> lentils or <i>Puy lentils<\/i> remain firm after cooking and have a rich flavor. They cook a bit slower than other lentils. Puy lentis can be replaced by beluga lentils or brown lentils (these won't hold their shape as well as French green lentils).","<i>Coconut cream<\/i> is similar to coconut milk but has a thicker, paste-like consistency. If you can't find coconut cream, use coconut milk instead. The lentil curry will then be more liquid.","<b>Vegetarian option:<b> omit the sauages and increase vegetables by 500 g.
