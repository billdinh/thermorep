For example, sunflower seeds have more than twice the calcium, almost four times as much folate and eight times more vitamin B3 than pepitas. But pepitas are higher in protein and magnesium and they have twice as much iron. Chia seeds and flaxseeds (linseeds) are both high in omega-3 fats, but chia seeds have more than twice the calcium, as well as more fibre and iron, while flaxseeds have twice the potassium and more folate. Using plenty of different seeds is ultimately your best nutritional bet."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","1h 30m","6 portions"]}
