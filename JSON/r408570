Please refer to <i>The Basic Cookbook<\/i> for the stock paste recipe. In step 3 replace liquid stock with 2 teaspoons stock paste and 120 g water.","If you like, make just the mash topping and serve it as a side dish with fish, steak or cutlets. It makes a delicious alternative to mashed potato.","Try to source properly ripe, naturally sweet tomatoes.","Instead of a large ovenproof baking dish, you can use 6 individual ovenproof dishes (approx. 450 mL capacity); you may need to reduce the baking time just a fraction."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","1h 15m","6 portions"]}
