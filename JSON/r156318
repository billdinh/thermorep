For a stronger broth, add extra vegetables or meat. <br>- For an even easier version, replace chicken wings with <b>2 heaped<b> teaspoons Chicken stock paste (refer to the recipe in The Basic Cookbook). <br>- Add <b>120 g<b> bacon or ham, cut into cubes, to dumplings."],"basicInfo":["medium","35m","1h 5m","4 portions"]}
