Bring to room temperature before using. Using aged egg whites will produce drier, firmer meringues, yielding a better result for macaron shells.","You can find food colouring gel at some major supermarkets and at most baking supply stores.","In humid climates, macarons could take up to 1 hour or more to form a crust. To speed up this process, heat your oven to its maximum temperature. Once heated, turn off the oven and place macaron shells into oven, leaving door open. Check shells regularly; they will be dried and ready when you can gently run your finger over the top of macarons without batter sticking to your finger.","You can use a silicone baking mat instead of a baking tray and baking paper, if desired.","If you have a conventional oven, bake macaron shells at 160°C.","You can store macaron shells in sealable containers for up to 1 week.","When folding powdered strawberry mixture into macaron shell batter, using a metal spoon helps retain the air in the egg white mixture.","Instead of piping ganache onto shells, you can spoon mixture onto them. However, a piping bag will be faster and gives you more control.","You can store macarons in a sealable container for up to 3 days.","You can omit rose water from shells and ganache, if desired."],"basicInfo":["medium","20m","2h 50m","30 portions"]}
