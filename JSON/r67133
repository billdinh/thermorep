If you prefer cooking the pasta in the traditional method, pre-cook lasagne pasta sheets in a large pot of salted boiling water (approx. 1 tsp salt per litre of water) for approx. 5 minutes. Drain in Varoma dish and blot excess moisture by placing lasagne pasta sheets in a single layer on top of a kitchen towel. Prepare the pasta while the béchamel sauce is cooking.","Leftovers keep well in the freezer."],"basicInfo":["medium","40m","2h 30m","6 portions"]}
