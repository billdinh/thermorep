For a fresh summer flavour, replace dill with fresh mint or coriander.","Instead of flour use <b>150 g cooked<b> potatoes, cut into pieces, to thicken the soup.<br>- For a thicker soup, replace milk with pouring (whipping) cream.<br>- For a vegetarian option, replace prawns with small mushrooms <b>(3 cm),<b> feta cheese cubes, or tofu cubes marinated in soy sauce; and replace lemon slices with cherry tomatoes.<br>- Try adding a splash of dry white wine to the soup in the final step."],"basicInfo":["easy","25m","35m","6 portions"]}
