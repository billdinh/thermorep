Cut it into pieces your baby can easily hold.","<strong>Toddler's serve<\/strong>: serve as is, cut up if needed.","If you are new to pizza making, you might prefer to use more baker's flour and less spelt flour - use whichever amounts you like as long as you use a total of 520 g flour. The more baker's flour you use, the higher the gluten content and the easier it will be to stretch out and work with the pizza dough.","If you're time poor, you can add another ½ teaspoon yeast and the dough will prove in approx. 30-40 minutes.","You can use wholemeal or white spelt flour in this recipe. The wholemeal flour produces a denser result.","If you don't have pizza trays, after dividing the dough into three portions, you can simply roll out the dough using a rolling pin and place onto a lined baking tray (or pizza stone) instead. I like it rolled as thinly as possible - just thick enough to support the topping.","The riper your tomatoes, the sweeter the sauce will be.","You can replace the basil with oregano in the Vegetable sauce recipe.","If you only want to make 1-2 pizzas, you can roll the leftover pizza dough into balls for bread rolls. After shaping into balls, set aside for a further 30 minutes, then bake for 15 minutes (210°C) or until cooked through."],"basicInfo":["easy","30m","2h","30 slices"]}
