The more baker's flour you use, the higher the gluten content and the easier it will be to stretch out and work with the pizza dough.","If you're time poor, you can add another ½ teaspoon yeast and the dough will prove in approx. 30-40 minutes.","You can use wholemeal or white spelt flour in this recipe. The wholemeal flour produces a denser result.","If you don't have pizza trays, after dividing the dough into three portions, you can simply roll out the dough using a rolling pin and place onto a lined baking tray (or pizza stone) instead.
