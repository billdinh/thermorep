The more baker's flour you use, the higher the gluten content and the easier it will be to stretch out and work with the pizza dough.","If you're time poor, you can add another ½ teaspoon yeast and the dough will prove in approx. 30-40 minutes.","You can use wholemeal or white spelt flour in this recipe. The wholemeal flour produces a denser result.","If you don't have pizza trays, after dividing the dough into three portions, you can simply roll out the dough using a rolling pin and place onto a lined baking tray (or pizza stone) instead. I like it rolled as thinly as possible - just thick enough to support the topping.","The riper your tomatoes, the sweeter the sauce will be.","You can replace the basil with oregano in the Vegetable sauce recipe.","If you only want to make 1-2 pizzas, you can roll the leftover pizza dough into balls for bread rolls.
