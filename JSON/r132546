Using a butter knife, loosen the skin at the front of the chicken. Add reserved tapenade with a teaspoon between loosened skin and chicken breast. Press the skin with your fingers to spread the tapenade from the back to the front of the chicken. Stuff the chicken with its filling and bundle the chicken legs together with a kitchen string. Season skin with salt, black pepper and paprika. Then place the prepared chicken in a casserole dish and add chicken stock to it. Bake for 1 hour (180°C), then increase oven temperature to 200°C and bake a further 30 minutes.
