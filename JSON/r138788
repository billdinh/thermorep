Transfer into a sealable container and set aside until required or make into a modelling paste (see Tips)."}],"hintsAndTricks":["<strong data-mce-contenteditable=\"false\">Modelling paste:<\/strong>  Modelling paste is used to make decorations that need to be firm enough to hold their shape. On a silicone bread mat or work surface, sprinkle tylose over fondant (use 1½-2 tsp tylose for every 500 g fondant). Knead modelling paste for 3-5 minutes to fully incorporate tylose and until fondant is smooth and crease free.","Tylose is a vegetable gum, available from cake decorating supply stores, and when added to fondant it makes a paste firm enough to model with and will hold its shape.","Work quickly with modelling paste and keep it well covered while working with it.","<strong data-mce-contenteditable=\"false\"><\/strong>Glycerine is an edible product and can be purchased from cake decorating shops or the health and beauty aisle in most supermarkets.","We recommend using a soft, sifted icing sugar for this recipe.","Liquid food colouring may affect the texture of your fondant and modelling paste; add sifted icing sugar as needed. Once your fondant or modelling paste is coloured, try to avoid excess use of icing sugar when rolling or modelling as this will leave white marks. We recommend natural gel food colouring when possible.","If your fondant or modelling paste feels dry and cracks, feels very firm or crumbly, knead in a few drops of glycerine or a few drops of cooled boiled water to soften and make it more elastic. This will help avoid cracks in the finished product. You can also rub some Copha (white vegetable shortening) onto your palms and work surface and continue to knead.","Fondant will keep for up to 2 months at room temperature. Fondant can be frozen for up to 1 month; simply bring back to room temperature before using.","Fondant\/modelling paste dries out quickly, so we recommend always keeping it wrapped in plastic wrap inside a snaplock bag."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","25m","1 total recipe"]}
