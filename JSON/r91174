Line prepared pie pan with dough or cut out shapes and place them on prepared baking sheet. For a pie shell or crust, prick pastry with fork to avoid air bubbles.

For cookies made with cookie cutters, roll the log so the cross section is round. For a pie shell, make a flatter log. Wrap log in cling wrap and refrigerate until firm enough to cut into slices. For round cookies, cut round log into slices <b>(¼ in. thick)<b> and bake as directed by the recipe. For a pie shell or crust, line the pie pan with long dough slices <b>(¼ in. thick),<b> overlapping them slightly, and press dough with fingers to fill in any cracks. Bake as directed by the recipe.","<strong>Decorated Cookies<\/strong>: decorate cookie shapes with colored icing, chocolate coating and sweets.","<strong>Jam-Filled Cookies<\/strong>: spread cool cookie with jam and place another on top.
