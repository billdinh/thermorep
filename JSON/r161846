Use the best extra virgin olive oil available.","When cooking pasta, follow the cooking time indicated on the package, or to your liking. Pasta that is cooked al dente is tender but still firm to the bite.","Tearing instead of cutting basil into pieces releases more flavor and prevents oxidation."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","45m","6 portions"]}
