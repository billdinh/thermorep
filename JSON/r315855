They may also lower bad cholesterol levels, improve heart health and improve digestion. You can find them at some major supermarkets, chemists and health food stores.","We prefer to use refined coconut oil as it has a milder flavour. However, both refined and unrefined coconut oil can be used in this recipe.","With a cheesy, umami flavour, nutritional yeast contains all nine essential amino acids, is a great source of B vitamins and is often fortified with vitamin B12 (important for those following a vegan diet). You can find nutritional yeast at health food stores or online.","Agar agar yields the best results when combined with hot liquids, then transferred into the refrigerator to set. You can find agar agar powder at health food stores, some Asian food stores and online.","To make your own sauerkraut, refer to the recipe on Cookidoo (www.cookidoo.com.au).","You can store this cheese in the refrigerator for up to 1 week."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","3h 40m","1"]}
