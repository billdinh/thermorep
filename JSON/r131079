Bake the vanilla cake first, and turn it out immediately onto a wire rack to cool. Wash, dry and prepare the tin, and use this for the third cake.","Use the built-in Thermomix scales to measure out the exact quantity of cake batter for each cake tin. At the end of the recipe, turn scales on, lift out mixing bowl and pour some cake batter into the prepared tin. When you return the mixing bowl to the base, it will show a minus figure indicating the weight removed (- 320 g).","Lollipops are a fun way to decorate this cake, however other confectionery can also be used.
