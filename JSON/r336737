Roll each piece of dough with a rolling pin into an elongated shape and feed through the pasta machine while guiding the dough.

Fold and roll the dough three more times on this setting. Adjust rollers to the next level of thinness and guide dough back through the machine with the back of your hand, repeating the process until dough is approximately 1\/16 inch thick.
