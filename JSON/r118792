Keep your oil at this temperature while frying. Working in batches, coat squid in reserved flour mixture and gently shake off any excess flour. Carefully drop squid into oil and fry for approx. 2 minutes or until very light golden. Carefully transfer squid onto paper towel to drain and immediately sprinkle with salt mixture and garnish with chives. Repeat until all squid is cooked.
