You might like to start with softer options, such as pieces of avocado or steamed sweet potato, before progressing to slightly firmer foods like this frittata. Some babies cannot master many finger foods until ten months or older.","Be sure to always keep a close eye on your baby when they are eating, as they may be completely silent when choking.","If you don't have any spelt flour on hand, you can also use regular plain flour or wholemeal flour."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","45m","18 portions"]}
