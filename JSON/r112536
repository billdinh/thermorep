Pour ⅓ of a cup of batter into pan to form a thin pancake and cook until bubbles appear on the top of pancake (approx. 30 seconds). Carefully flip pancake and cook for a further 10 seconds. Carefully transfer to lined plate and cover with a sheet of baking paper and a kitchen towel to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter to make a total of 6 pancakes.","Preheat oven to 200°C. Line a baking tray (30 x 40 cm) with baking paper.","Place 1 pancake onto baking tray. Place 2 tablespoons of the asparagus mixture into the centre of the pancake. Using the back of a spoon, make an indent in the middle of the filling. Carefully crack an egg into the indent. Working quickly, fold up each side of pancake to enclose asparagus mixture, leaving the yolk exposed, to form a square. If needed, push corners down and secure with toothpicks to help galette hold its shape. Repeat with remaining pancakes, filling and eggs to create a total of 6 galettes.","Sprinkle with pepper and bake for 10-12 minutes (200 °C), or until eggs are baked to your liking. Serve immediately. "]}],"ingredients":[{"title":"Batter","content":["140 g buckwheat","2 tsp salt","140 g full cream milk","140 g beer  (lager)","2 eggs"]},{"title":"Filling","content":["120 g Gruyère cheese, cut into pieces (2 cm)","20 g oil, plus extra for frying","115 g pancetta, cut into pieces (2 cm)","1 eschalot","220 g asparagus, trimmed and cut into thin slices","6 eggs","1 pinch freshly ground black pepper"]}],"id":"r112536","imageLink":"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-tiK6XF52nvs\/XZQxYjdwXuI\/AAAAAAAAcuk\/VVwdJDltyP4j710L2MXew8wKhgrTzz38gCLcBGAsYHQ\/s1600\/0_qpDZOeBu-8oj-YPv.png","title":"Pancetta and asparagus galettes","publishedAt":"2016-11-20T00:00:00Z","nutrition":{"protein":"25.9 g","fat":"21 g","uom":"per 1 portions","carbohydrates":"18.2 g","calories":"1582 kJ \/ 376 kcal"},"usefulItems":"jug, plastic wrap, bowl, kitchen towel, non-stick frying pan, 1 plate, baking paper, baking tray (30 x 40 cm), toothpick, refrigerator, stove top, oven","hintsAndTricks":["To save time, prepare your batter through step 4 the night before and store in the refrigerator until ready to use.","You can use any type of cheese in this recipe."],"basicInfo":["easy","35m","1h 5m","6 portions"]}
