The result may be more uneven, because the egg whites may spread out more.","<i>This recipe produces a result somewhere between a fried and a poached egg, using neither a pan nor a stove, and very little fat. Choose the freshest eggs you can find to showcase their flavour, as the gentle steaming cooks them to a delicate texture. Given the size of the Varoma tray, we recommend cooking six eggs at a time, but feel free to experiment with as many or few eggs as you like.<\/i>","Serve for breakfast or as a side dish.<br>- If the egg whites are not quite set, leave Varoma covered (still on mixing bowl lid) to finish cooking gently in the residual heat for <b>1-2 minutes.<b><br>- If you prefer a firmer yolk, prolong steaming time by <b>1 minute.<b><br>- For eggs cooked from room temperature, reduce the cooking time by <b>20-30 seconds.<b>","Sprinkle some crumbled bacon, small pieces of ham, chopped chives or grated cheese on the eggs before steaming."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","15m","6 pieces"]}
