As the middle is thinner, the whole burger will cook at the same time.","When frying the burgers, the lamb mince will release fat so adding oil is usually not necessary. If using a mince with lower fat quantity or if burgers start sticking to the pan, add oil as necessary.","Mayonnaise and burgers can be prepared in advance and stored in fridge.
