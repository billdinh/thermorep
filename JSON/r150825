The fresh herbed yoghurt sauce and the leeks steamed until meltingly soft offer a pleasant contrast to the hot cheese flans. You can also experiment with different types of soft cheeses to change the flavour of the dish.<\/i>","The flans can also be served cold as a starter, with fresh green lettuce and diced tomatoes.<br>- For a stronger flavour, replace goat’s cheese with blue cheese (e.g. Stilton,Gorgonzola) in the flan and <b>60 g<b> blue cheese in the yoghurt sauce."],"basicInfo":["easy","30m","45m","4 portions"]}
