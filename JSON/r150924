Choose the best eggs you can find to showcase their flavour, as the gentle steaming cooks them consistently to a delicate texture. Given the size of the Varoma tray, we recommend cooking six eggs at a time, but feel free to experiment with fewer eggs.<\/i>","Sprinkle some bacon cubes, small pieces of ham, chopped chives or grated cheese on the eggs before steaming.","Steam fewer eggs (1-5), if desired. The result may be more uneven, because the egg whites may spread out more.","Serve for breakfast or as a side dish.<br>- If egg whites are not quite set, leave Varoma covered (still on mixing bowl lid) to finish cooking gently in residual heat for <b>1-2 minutes.<b><br>- If you prefer a firmer yolk, prolong steaming time by <b>1 minute.<b><br>- For eggs cooked from room temperature, reduce cooking time by <b>20-30 seconds.<b>"],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","15m","6 pieces"]}
