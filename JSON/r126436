Simply top each (uncooked) friand with a raspberry before baking.","Soy milk can be replaced with almond milk.","If you don’t have a friand tin, you can also use a muffin tray and line 8 of the holes with paper cases. Depending on the size of your tin, your portions may vary.","You can make your own brown ride flour in your Thermomix from scratch. Place 250 g brown rice flour into mixing bowl and mill <strong>2 min\/speed 10<\/strong> to a fine consistancy. Store the leftover flour in a sealable container in your freezer or refrigerator to preserve its nutrient content and keep it fresh for longer.","I suggest using a lightly-flavoured extra virgin olive oil as it's much more mild."],"basicInfo":["medium","25m","2h 25m","8 portions"]}
