Though made without oil or butter, the texture is very soft thanks to the rich layer of sweet azuki bean paste. Azuki beans are small red beans that are frequently used in sweets and desserts in Asia. Refer to the variations if you have difficulty sourcing ingredients for this recipe.<\/i>","Replace azuki beans with dried red kidney beans. After soaking and draining them as for the azuki beans, in <b>step 1<b> use <b>750 g water<b> and cook for <b>95 minutes<b> instead of <b>45 minutes.<b> Continue with recipe.<br>- Instead of <b>step 4,<b> grind your own rice flour mix: place <b>100 g white<b> short-grain rice (pudding or risotto rice) and <b>125 g glutinous<b> (sticky) rice or sushi rice in dry mixing bowl and grind <b>2 min\/speed 10.<b> Scrape down sides of mixing bowl with spatula and grind a further <b>1 min\/speed 10.<b> Add icing sugar and <b>35 g milk<b> and knead <b>1 min\/,<b> then blend <b>30 sec\/speed 10<b> and transfer powdery mixture to a bowl. Continue with recipe in <b>step 5.<b><br>- Use fruit jam or chocolate spread instead of azuki bean paste.","Azuki bean paste is cooked in three stages for the best possible flavour and texture. The first boiling eliminates bitter-tasting tannins and the second cooking ensures the beans soften fully before sugar is added in the final cooking stage.<br>- Azuki beans (also called adzuki or aduki beans), white rice flour and glutinous rice flour are available in Asian or Japanese supermarkets.<br>- You can make azuki bean paste in advance and chill for up to <b>1 week,<b> or purchase it ready-made."],"basicInfo":["medium","35m","8h 30m","6 portions"]}
