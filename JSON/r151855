Proving should take place in a constant temperature environment. Low temperature will lead to longer proving time, high temperature (above 40°C) may weaken or kill the yeast. To create a warm environment, you can place the shaped brioche in a turned-off cool oven with a bowl of hot water inside.","<b>Brioche à tête<b> (traditional French brioche shape): divide dough into <b>2 pieces,<b> one large <b>(⅘ of<b> the final loaf) and one small (⅕). Form both pieces into smooth balls. Place the large ball in a greased fluted brioche tin, and using your fingers, create a deep indentation in the middle until your fingers are touching the bottom of the tin. Roll the small ball of dough into a tear-drop shape, with a longer, pointy part. Place the pointy part of the small piece of dough in the indentation of the large ball, forming a \"head\", and push down deeply all around the head to tuck it firmly into the large ball of dough.
