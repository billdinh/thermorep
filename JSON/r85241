Alternatively roll dough out on a floured surface using a rolling pin until as thin as possible (1 mm).","Fold over in half lengthwise, then unfold. In centre of the bottom half, below crease line, dot heaped teaspoons of filling at approx. 8 cm intervals.","Brush round each mound of filling with a wet pastry brush, then fold top half of dough over filling and press down lightly with your fingers in between each mound to squeeze out excess air.
