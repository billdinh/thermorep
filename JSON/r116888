For more information see www.jennytschiesche.com.<\/p>","Soaking nuts and seeds increases their nutrient value along with breaking down the problematic compounds that help enhance their digestibility. Activating nuts is actually a traditional practice that historically required the soaking of both nuts and seeds in salty water and letting them dry in the sun. Without the level of sunshine required to do this in many countries and with slightly more sanitary methods of drying we can activate nuts in our own kitchens. We can do this by a) using a dehydrator for around 12-24 hours or using an oven, at the lowest temperature possible, preferably no more than 65°C. Stir or turn them occasionally, for the required drying time.","See Raw Chocolate Brownie Recipe for a way to use up leftover almond pulp."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","8h 40m","1 total recipe"]}
