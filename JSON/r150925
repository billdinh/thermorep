If you’ve never shaped dumplings before, take your time and practise. The next time you make these, you will be much faster – and you may find that you enjoy the process just as much as the fresh, homemade flavour of the end result!<\/i>","These dumplings are usually served with a dip of Chinese black rice vinegar or soy sauce, or a mixture of both (e.g. <b>3 Tbsp<b> soy sauce <b>+ 1 Tbsp<b> black or white vinegar). Chopped garlic and chilli can also be added.<br>- If you're in a hurry, use ready-made dumpling wrappers available in Asian supermarkets.<br>- You can prepare dumplings ahead of time and freeze them.
