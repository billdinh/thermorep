Using the floss puts less pressure on the roll and prevents loss of filling. Cut a 9-12 inch length of floss, slide it under the roll at where you want the cut, grab both ends of the floss in each hand, crossing over the top of the roll. Pull the floss taut until the slice is cut."],"basicInfo":["medium","10m","2h","24 pieces"]}
