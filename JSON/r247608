According to Italian folklore, the pasta was invented at a tavern in the town of Castelfranco Emilia where Venus, the goddess of love, stayed for a night. The exact details of the story vary but it is thought the innkeeper spied on Venus and then rushed to his kitchen to create pasta that resembled her belly button. We’ve added a twist to the classic veal-filled tortelloni by adding blanched spinach to the dough, resulting in a vibrant green pasta that looks spectacular dressed simply with olive oil."],"basicInfo":["advanced","1h 15m","1h 50m","6 portions"]}
