Meanwhile, dust 2 large baking trays with flour and set aside."},{"content":"Gently tip out risen dough onto a well-floured surface, being careful not to deflate the dough too much. Using spatula, divide dough in 2 equal pieces then, using a rolling pin, flatten each into a rough oval shape (approx. 1.5 cm thick) using extra flour as needed to prevent dough from sticking. Sprinkle tops with flour."},{"content":"Transfer to floured baking trays then, using a sharp knife, make a diagonal cut through middle of each piece of dough, starting and finishing 2 cm from edge so that a rim of dough remains around the fougasse. Then cut 3 smaller slashes either side of central slash to a form a leaf pattern, again leaving a 2 cm rim of dough between each slash. Pull slashes open, using fingertips to form large holes which are at least 3 cm wide. Set aside to rise for a further 15 minutes. Meanwhile preheat oven to 240°C."},{"content":"Using fingertips, sprinkle 1 Tbsp water over risen dough. Bake for 15-20 minutes (240°C) until light golden brown. Transfer to wire racks and allow to cool before serving."}],"hintsAndTricks":["If you have enough time, do the first rising of the dough (step 2) slowly for 6-8 hours or overnight in a cool place (or in the fridge). This adds flavour and a lovely chewy texture to the fougasse. Note - the second rising will then take longer (step 4) - about 45-60 minutes.","Fougasse, which originates from Provence, is now a popular loaf all over France, and we hope you'll enjoy this easy and impressive bread too. The slashes provide the characteristic leaf pattern, and it may remind you of an Italian focaccia. It's a great bread to serve at a casual meal with friends as you can all tear it apart at the table."],"basicInfo":["medium","20m","2h","12 portions"]}
