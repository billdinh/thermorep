While the exact origins of the drink vary from region to region, there is no denying its popularity. With a unique flavour attained from using only the highest quality lemons grown in Campania, limoncello is enjoyed across Italy as a chilled digestif. We’ve used limoncello as a base for our sorbet, with fresh mint and basil resulting in a refreshing dessert that will impress anyone.","The mint and basil leaves can be left to infuse for up to <b>3 days<b> before freezing.","Place serving bowls or glasses in the freezer <b>30 minutes<b> ahead of serving time to keep the sorbet chilled."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","18h 25m","6 portions"]}
