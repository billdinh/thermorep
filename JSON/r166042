This is especially important when using cookie cutters that have more detail.","These soft and citrusy cookies are a fun twist to traditional sugar cookies. For holiday gifts use fun cookie cutter shapes and decorate with icing, sanding sugar and candies.","Citrus fruit is at its peak during winter through spring so take advantage of the variety by using more unusual fruit. Replace regular orange peel with peel from blood oranges, satsumas, Meyer lemons and even Jamaican grapefruits."],"basicInfo":["medium","45m","55m","36 pieces"]}
