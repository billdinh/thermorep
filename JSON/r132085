It has a strong odour, but the aroma softens as it cooks, and tastes similar to onion and garlic, enhancing the flavour of savoury dishes. It helps reduce flatulence and constipation, and reduces the growth of microflora in the gut. A little goes a long way, so only a small amount is needed. Both mung dal and asafoetida can be found in Indian grocers or online. Mung dal can also be found in some supermarkets.","Rasam is an integral part of south Indian meals and is more like a soup. It is often sipped in small amounts after meals to help aid digestion, or it can be poured over plain rice or used to moisten dry curries. It's often used medicinally to help ease colds and flu."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","40m","4 portions"]}
