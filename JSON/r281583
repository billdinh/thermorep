The steak filling and guacamole topping come together in the time it takes the sweet potatoes to bake, making a tasty and easy midweek meal option.","To slice steak, find the direction of the grain (the lines of muscle fibre) and slice across the grain rather than parallel to it.","The sweet potatoes add a lovely flavour to this dish but if you’d prefer you can use ordinary baking potatoes."],"basicInfo":["easy","35m","1h","6 portions"]}
