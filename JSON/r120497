Transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool before serving cold or slightly warm."}],"hintsAndTricks":["Adding rye flour to a dough brings with it another flavour dimension. Both malty and nutty in taste, the dough will be slightly darker in colour and denser than a bread made purely from white bread flour.  An easy, everyday bread recipe, these rolls would make a good accompaniment to a bowl of soup or can be filled for sandwich rolls for a weekday lunch on the go."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","4h","12 pieces"]}
