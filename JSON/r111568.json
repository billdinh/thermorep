Most of the ghee will be left in the steaming water but you will still have a lovely ghee flavour in the rice.","For a fat-free version, omit ghee completely.","A simple rice dish lightly spiced with cumin. Adding ingredients during the cooking of the rice enhances the taste of the finished dish. This is made easy with the Thermomix as the infusion of flavours happens during the steaming process. Also try other ingredients such as lemon peel, onion seeds, cinnamon or curry leaves."],"basicInfo":["easy","5m","25m","6 portions"]}
