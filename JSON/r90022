Adapt the toppings as you feel inspired, choosing ingredients that will add both colour and flavour to the silky egg custard. Serve as a starter or as one of several small dishes in a main course. It is also pleasant served chilled on a hot day.","Steam in any heat-resistant cup or small bowl of similar size. If your dishes are a different size or they are not ceramic, you may have to adjust the cooking time. Once you know the perfect cooking time for your own dishes, make a note of it for next time.","Dashi, or Japanese cooking stock, adds flavour to the chawan mushi. You can replace the instant dashi powder with <nobr>½ tsp homemade<\/nobr> chicken or vegetable stock paste: first dilute the stock paste in some of the water before adding it in <nobr>step 1,<\/nobr> and reduce salt to <nobr>¼ tsp.<\/nobr> Or omit instant dashi powder and use <nobr>300 g stock<\/nobr> instead of water in <nobr>step 1.<\/nobr> Finally you can omit the instant dashi powder altogether; the dish will have a more subtle egg flavour that is also very pleasant."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","35m","6 portions"]}
