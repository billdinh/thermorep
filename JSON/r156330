Feel free to use a normal orange jam or marmalade with the extra lemon juice if you can't find a Seville variety. Marinating and steaming the duck makes it beautifully tender, and if you'd like to <b>serve 4<b> and share the enjoyment, see our doubling tip.<\/i>","Replace green beans with vegetables of your choice in step 6 (such as thinly sliced carrots, Brussels sprouts cut into halves, shredded savoy cabbage, sliced red capsicums or pak choi). Place the vegetables that require the longest steaming time into the simmering basket first.<br>- To <b>serve 4,<b> use <b>4 duck<b> breasts, increase ingredients for marinade by <b>1½ times,<b> and double the ingredients for mashed potatoes and beans. Water for steaming and the recipe instructions remain unchanged.","Potatoes must be cooked through and tender before mashing to create a creamy mash that is lump-free and not gluey. In <b>step 4,<b> cook potatoes <b>5-10 minutes<b> longer if needed - cooking time depends on potato variety.<br>- If you buy duck breasts with skin, they should be <b>approx. 225-300 g each.<b> Peel off skin and fat with the help of a small sharp knife before marinating duck.<br>- Duck breasts can be marinated for up to <b>24 hours<b> before steaming. In <b>step 2,<b> place duck and marinade into a sealed bag or covered container and place into refrigerator. When ready to cook, transfer duck and marinade onto lined Varoma tray and continue with recipe."],"basicInfo":["medium","35m","1h 10m","2 portions"]}
