Once cooked and cooled, break vegetable crackers into bite size pieces or gently break into shapes.","Crackers can be left plain or garnished with sesame seeds, poppy seeds, pumpkin seeds or salt and pepper before baking.","Cooking time depends on the oven and its functions and\/or brand of dehydrator. Cook crackers until they are dry and crisp. You can use a dehydrator oven function or the warming function on your oven if you do not have a stand-alone dehydrator.
