Fewer apples will be necessary for topping the smaller surface of the cake.","Apples can be substituted with pears (prepared as per apples), plums (halved and stones removed), peaches (halved, stones removed, and prepared as per apples), apricots (halved and stones removed), or any other fruit to your taste.  The amount of fruit pieces depends on the size of the cake. You need enough to distribute evenly over the surface of the cake.","Brandy can be substituted with rum."],"basicInfo":["medium","20m","1h","8 slices"]}
