Adding cardamom and toasted nuts takes this classic to a new level. You may vary the spices, the nuts or even the presentation: serve as part of a buffet in individual small glasses, as described in the variation.<\/i>","The steamed pears can be prepared in advance. Make the chocolate sauce just before serving and pour over chilled or room temperature pears.<br>- Try serving with whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.","For a different presentation, cut pears into small pieces <nobr>(0.5-1 cm)<\/nobr> after steaming and serve in small glasses, drizzled with chocolate sauce and sprinkled with nuts.<br>- Replace cardamom with cinnamon or other spices as desired.<br>- Instead of shop-bought flaked almonds, prepare your own nuts: before starting the recipe preheat oven to 160°C, spread whole nuts (e.g. almonds, pistachios, pecans) in a single layer on a baking tray and toast for <nobr>10 minutes.<\/nobr> Once cooled, place nuts into mixing bowl and chop <nobr><strong>5-10 sec\/speed 5<\/strong><\/nobr> and sprinkle over pears."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","40m","4 portions"]}
