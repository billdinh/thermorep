Also known as 'wheat meat', 'wheat protein' or 'wheat gluten' it has a savoury taste which is fairly mild on its own. It can be bought plain or with flavourings already added and is a very versatile ingredient, especially useful for those following a vegetarian diet."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","2h 10m","6 portions"]}
