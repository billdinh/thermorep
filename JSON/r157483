Replace Parmesan with different strong flavored cheeses, such as Feta cubes or Gruyere. Rice will absorb as many flavors as you incorporate, so experiment with ingredients you love.","The use of Italian Arborio is recommended in the Thermomix as the higher starch content and fuller grain size of this rice both contribute to a perfect risotto."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","30m","4 portions"]}
