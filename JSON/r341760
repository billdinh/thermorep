To press tofu, use a tofu press or line a plate with paper towels. Place tofu block on the paper towels and cover with another layer of paper towel. Place a plate or a cutting board on top of the paper towels, then place heavy weights (books or cans) on top. Set aside for several hours until liquid has been pressed out.","We recommend using organic tofu whenever possible.","Be sure to check the label of your tamari, as not all brands are gluten free.","If you prefer to steam your tofu rather than fry it, place into Varoma with bok choy and proceed as per recipe.","You can replace the tofu with chickpea tofu, if desired (refer to the Burmese chickpea tofu recipe on this recipe chip)."],"basicInfo":["easy","25m","40m","4 portions"]}
