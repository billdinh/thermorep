Tasty minestrone soup, a pork roll filled with flavourful bacon and sun-dried tomato stuffing, served with Mediterranean vegetables. Follow that with steamed raspberry puddings, the batter of which, when baked instead of steamed, produces completely different but equally wonderful berry muffins.<\/i>","For the muffins, use an 8-hole or 12-hole muffin tray, leaving some holes unfilled depending on how much batter you have left. For the puddings, use any heatproof individual muffin or pudding moulds that fit <b>4 on<b> Varoma tray.<br>- After baking, allow muffins to cool for 5 minutes in the tin, then transfer to a wire rack. Once at room temperature, sprinkle with icing sugar, store in an airtight container and serve within 24 hours.<br>- Serve a spoonful of whipped cream or crème fraîche with the steamed puddings.<br>- If you have room in your fridge, you can prepare this recipe the night before. Prepare up until <b>step 9,<b> stopping just before steaming. Place prepared Varoma, mixing bowl and simmering basket in the fridge. When ready to finish, continue recipe from steaming in <b>step 9.<b>","Use different berries or small pieces of mango or banana for the muffins.<br>- Use other jams or marmalades in the steamed puddings instead of raspberry jam."],"basicInfo":["medium","45m","1h 40m","4 portions"]}
