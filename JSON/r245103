As it requires no churning, it is even easier to make than gelato! It also contains whipped cream, which means it doesn’t freeze as solidly as ice cream so the end result is deliciously smooth and creamy. Typically frozen in loaf-shaped tins, the presentation once turned out allows for elegant layers of different colours and textures that can be seen once sliced. This stunning version has a creamy white, pistachio-studded layer on the bottom, topped with a delicate blush-hued layer of strawberry purée."],"basicInfo":["medium","15m","18h","8 slices"]}
