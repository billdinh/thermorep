After first rise gently fold dough over itself to deflate it, cover bowl with cling wrap and place in refrigerator. Continue with the recipe at your convenience up to <b>24 hours<b> later, allowing more time for the loaf to rise the second time.","This is a rich brioche dough that requires long kneading and long proving (rising) for the fluffiest texture.","Rising times depend on ambient temperature. Proving should take place in a constant temperature environment. Low temperature will lead to longer proving time, high temperature (above 104°F) may weaken or kill the yeast. To create a warm environment you can place the shaped brioche in a turned-off cool oven with a bowl of hot water near it.","<strong>Brioche à tête<\/strong> (traditional French brioche shape): divide dough into <b>2 pieces,<b> one large <b>(⅘ of<b> the final loaf) and one small (⅕). Form both pieces into smooth balls. Place the large ball in a greased fluted brioche tin, and using your fingers, create a deep indentation in the middle until your fingers are touching the bottom of the tin. Roll the small ball of dough into a tear-drop shape, with a longer, pointy part. Place the pointy part of the small piece of dough in the indentation of the large ball, forming a \"head\", and push down deeply all around the head to tuck it firmly into the large ball of dough. Let rise, then bake as directed by the recipe."],"basicInfo":["medium","25m","8h","16 slices"]}
