Cheaper meats cook better over a long period of time, making this the perfect recipe to use chuck steak or casserole beef.","This stew will freeze well in a freezable container. The dumplings do not freeze as well, so if you are planning to only eat half of the stew after cooking, halve the dumpling ingredient quantities and proceed as per recipe. Then, while thawing and re-heating the reserved stew, make a fresh batch of dumplings (placing 700 g water into mixing bowl for steaming dumplings)."],"basicInfo":["easy","30m","1h 40m","6 portions"]}
