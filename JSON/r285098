Tender lamb seasoned with Turkish chilli flakes is rolled in buttery puff pastry, then baked until golden and crisp. Served with freekeh, an ancient, protein-rich grain with an earthy, nutty flavour, this impressive main would make a great choice next time you’re entertaining friends or family.","Use low-fat mince, otherwise too much fat may leak out during cooking causing the pastry to become soggy.","Try to use Urfa chilli flakes, if available. These flakes have a very particular taste - smoky, sweet, earthy but not too spicy.","To make your own puff pastry, follow the recipe in <i>The Basic Cookbook<\/i>.","This recipe also works with filo pastry - wrap in <b>6 large<b> sheets. Brush with melted butter and reduce cooking time slightly."],"basicInfo":["medium","35m","1h 5m","8 portions"]}
