Gently flatten and roll each piece loosely into a log shape and set aside on a ThermoMat or floured surface. Dust logs lightly with flour, wrap loosely in ThermoMat or cover with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel and leave to prove for 20 minutes."},{"content":"Again, flatten each log very gently into a rectangle, taking care not to knock out the air. Roll dough again into a log shape. Pinch ends of logs with your fingers to seal. Work logs into baguette shapes, gently rolling back and forth. Place baguettes seam-side down on baking paper, then pull paper up to create a low wall and separate baguettes. Cover baguettes loosely with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel and allow to prove for a further 45 minutes."},{"content":"Twenty minutes before end of proving time, place 2 baking trays into lower part of oven, one tray on the lowest rung, the other on a rung above then preheat oven to 250°C."},{"content":"Once bread has proved, carefully prepare approx. 100 g very hot water in a cup. Slash baguettes with a very sharp knife, making three parallel slashes along the length of the bread."},{"content":"Slide baguettes, together with baking paper, onto the top preheated baking tray. Quickly, but also carefully, splash the hot water onto the lower baking tray to create steam and immediately close oven door to trap steam. Bake for 20 minutes (250°C), or until dark golden brown. If baguettes seem too brown before end of baking time, reduce oven temperature to 230°C. Allow baguettes to cool for 20 minutes before slicing and serving."}],"hintsAndTricks":["To test if baguettes are ready to bake, gently press dough with your fingertip. The indentation left by your finger should slowly disappear. If the dough springs up quickly more proving time is needed. If the indentation remains, the dough has been left to prove too long. The baguette will not rise as much during baking but the end result will taste the same.","Creating the burst of steam at the beginning of baking gives the baguettes their crisp, golden crust. Be very careful not to splash yourself or any glass elements in your oven. You can omit the step of creating the steam if desired.","Baguettes are always best eaten freshly baked.","Baguettes taste even better if you chill the dough overnight in the refrigerator. After the dough has proven in step 2, gently de-gas the dough by folding it over itself, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator. The next day proceed with step 3 as per recipe. The baguettes may need 10-20 minutes longer to prove in step 4 prior to baking."],"basicInfo":["advanced","30m","3h 45m","3 pieces"]}
