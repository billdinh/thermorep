Gently flatten and roll each piece loosely into a log shape and set aside on a lightly-floured surface. Dust rolls lightly with flour, cover with cling film or a damp tea towel and leave to rest for 20 minutes."},{"content":"Gently flatten each piece of dough again into a rectangle, taking care to preserve air bubbles trapped within. Roll dough again into a log shape. Pinch seam of roll with fingers to seal. Elongate roll into a baguette shape, rolling back and forth exerting gentle pressure from the middle of the baguette to its ends. Place baguettes, seam side down, on baking paper, pulling up paper between baguettes to create a low divider. This will help baguettes to hold their shape and prevent them from sticking to each other as they rise. Cover baguettes loosely with cling film or a damp tea towel and leave to prove for a further 45 minutes."},{"content":"Towards the end of rising time, place 2 baking trays (approx. 40 cm x 35 cm) in lower part of oven, one tray on lowest shelf, the other on the shelf above. Preheat oven to 250°C."},{"content":"Prepare approx. 100 g very hot water in a cup. Slash baguettes with a very sharp knife, making three overlapping slashes along the length of each. Slide baguettes, together with baking paper, onto the top preheated tray. Quickly but <strong>carefully<\/strong> splash the hot water onto the lower baking tray to create steam (see tip) and immediately close oven door to trap steam. Bake for 20 minutes (250°C) or until dark golden brown. If baguettes seem quite brown before end of baking time, reduce oven temperature to 230°C. Leave to cool for 20 minutes before slicing."}],"hintsAndTricks":["To test if baguettes are ready to bake, gently press dough with your fingertip. The indentation left by your finger should slowly disappear. If the dough springs up quickly then it has not risen sufficiently. If the indentation remains, the dough has over-proved. The baguettes won’t rise as much in the oven but they will still taste good.","Creating the burst of steam at the beginning of baking gives the baguettes their crisp, golden crust. Be very careful not to splash yourself or any glass elements in your oven. You may omit the steam if desired.","Baguettes are always best eaten freshly baked.","Baguettes develop more flavour if you chill the dough overnight in the fridge. After the dough has risen in <b>step 2,<b> gently fold dough over itself to deflate it, cover the bowl with cling film and store in the fridge. The next day, proceed with <b>step 3<b> as directed in the recipe. The baguettes may need <b>10-20 minutes<b> longer to rise in <b>step 4<b> before baking."],"basicInfo":["advanced","30m","3h 45m","30 slices"]}
