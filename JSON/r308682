Toast for a few minutes in a frying pan on hob before using to coat the turkey.","Substitute turkey with chicken.","You can also cut the meat into cubes (approx. <b>2 cm)<b> then assemble the kebabs, adjusting cooking time accordingly.","To make a complete meal, steam <b>40 g<b> rice per person in the simmering basket with <b>1000 g<b> water for <b><strong>22 min\/Varoma\/speed 3<\/strong>,<b> adding Varoma with turkey skewers for final <b>10 minutes.<b>","The longer you can leave the turkey skewers to marinate, the better the finished result, but they are still delicious when cooked immediately!","The turkey skewers can also be grilled.
