Prick pastry base with a fork, line with baking paper and baking weights (e. g. dried beans) and bake as indicated in the recipe.","Use boneless and skinless chicken thighs or chicken breast fillets. Chicken thigh meat will add more flavour to the filling, though.","Serve Chicken and pear pie as a hearty meal with your favourite steamed vegetables or salad on the side.","Leftovers store well in a sealable container in the refrigerator for lunches the next day.","To ensure gluten free recipes are gluten free, always read the labels of your products as some may contain traces of wheat or gluten."],"basicInfo":["medium","25m","2h 40m","8 portions"]}
