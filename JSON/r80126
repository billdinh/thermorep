Roll out pastry to line the base and sides of a greased tart tin and prick the base with a fork or pastry docker to prevent air bubbles and rising. Line pastry base with baking paper and fill with rice, dried beans or pie weights (this will stop the pastry base from rising during baking). Place tart tin onto a baking tray and bake for 15 minutes (200°C). Remove from oven, then remove baking paper with rice, dried beans or pie weights. Return pastry case to oven and bake for a further 5-10 minutes (200°C) or until light golden.","This is a versatile pastry, any leftover can be used to make sausage rolls or kept frozen for later use. Roll out your pastry between two sheets of baking paper or plastic wrap before freezing to make defrosting easier later on.","This recipe fills a 24 cm tart tin.","Recipe contributed by pastry chef Maria Stuart."],"basicInfo":["easy","5m","25m","1 total recipe"]}
