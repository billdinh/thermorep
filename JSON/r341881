Place tofu block on the paper towels and cover with another layer of paper towel. Place a plate or a cutting board on top of the paper towels and then weigh it down with heavy books or cans. Set aside for several hours until liquid has been pressed out.","Be sure to check the label of your tamari, as not all brands are gluten free.","You can store the Lime mayo in the refrigerator for up to 2 days."],"basicInfo":["easy","30m","30m","4 portions"]}
