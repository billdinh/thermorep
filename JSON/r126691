Dust generously with flour and roll out on the baking trays, ensuring dough is thinner at centre than at sides. Cut longer side into 5 strips (à 8 cm) and shorter side into 3 strips (à 10 cm) to create 15 squares (10 x 8 cm) per baking tray. Spread half of the parmesan over the dough per tray and bake the trays of crispbread for 20 minutes (160°C) each.
