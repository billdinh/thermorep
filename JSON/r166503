Make sure to buy capsules with casings that can be separated and removed, not hard caplets.","Use a high-quality probiotic that contains a few of: Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus.","You can also use a few tablespoons of store-bought yogurt with <b>live<b> cultures.
