They can always be found in any chip shop in Sicily. They can have different shapes (oval, circular, elongated) and different fillings depending on local traditions. This recipe is for the “rosso” (red) rice ball with ragù sauce. Rice balls “al burro” (with butter) are also very popular as are those without saffron and stuffed with ham and cheese.","To grate your own Parmesan, place <b>80 g<b> Parmesan, cut in pieces <b>(2 cm),<b> in mixing bowl and grate <b><strong>10 sec\/speed 10<\/strong>.<b>","It is easier to shape and dip rice balls if you wash your hands in between each one or two."],"basicInfo":["medium","1h","3h 5m","18 pieces"]}
