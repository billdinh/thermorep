Rapadura sugar or coconut sugar are less refined options; if you don't have them on hand, regular brown sugar is a more affordable and local option.","Tahini adds depth of flavour to the Cashew cream icing, but if you don't have it on hand don't worry, it's still lovely without it.","Honey is not suitable for children under 1 year of age.","You can replace the honey with coconut nectar in this recipe."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","4h 20m","12 portions"]}
