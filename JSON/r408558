If serving to a baby, omit honey (see below) and cacao nibs and blend porridge to desired smoothness.","<strong>Toddler's serve<\/strong>: omit raw cacao nibs or chop them finely.","If preparing this for younger children, prepare without the honey, set aside their portion and then stir through honey for adult or older children's portions if you like.
