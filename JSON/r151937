Place dough on tea towel, dust with flour and using a rolling pin, roll out to a thin rectangular shape. Cover with second tea towel and allow to rest for 5 minutes.","Remove top tea towel and place on the table, its long edge overlapping slightly with the long edge of the other tea towel, to create a large surface on which to stretch the dough. Brush dough with some melted butter, then lift over backs of your hands and gently stretch it with your knuckles towards table edges. Move around the edge of the dough and keep stretching slowly and carefully toward and finally over the table edges, until dough is very large, thin and transparent. Use scissors to cut off thick edges of dough. If holes appear while stretching, pinch them together lightly (small holes will not be visible after rolling the strudel).","Brush entire dough surface with more melted butter, sprinkle reserved breadcrumb and hazelnut mixture in a wide band along shortest edge of the pastry, leaving a few cm of dough uncovered along the edge, then top the crumb mixture with apple filling, forming a narrower band than the breadcrumb mixture. Lift up cloth at filling edge, using it to flip the dough. Roll strudel by pulling the first tea towel upwards and continuing with the next tea towel until the whole strudel is rolled. Pinch ends of roll shut, cutting off unnecessary excess dough and tucking dough ends underneath roll. Using remaining tea towel, carefully transfer strudel to prepared baking tray, forming strudel into a horseshoe shape if necessary to make it fit.","Brush top with remaining melted butter. Bake for 25-30 minutes (190°C) or until crisp and golden. Allow to cool a little, dust with icing sugar and serve warm, cut in thick slices."]}],"ingredients":[{"title":"Strudel pastry","content":["370 g plain flour","1 egg","70 g sunflower oil","120 g water","1 tsp white wine vinegar","½ tsp salt"]},{"title":"Apple filling","content":["100 g hazelnuts","130 g butter, unsalted, cut in pieces","80 g breadcrumbs","1 tsp ground cinnamon","100 g sugar","1 Tbsp vanilla sugar, homemade","20 g lemon juice","20 g rum              (optional)","750 g apples, peeled","80 g raisins"]},{"title":"Strudel assembly","content":["plain flour, for dusting","icing sugar, for dusting"]}],"id":"r151937","imageLink":"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-e40qpx5g5sY\/XZWrSTYl7uI\/AAAAAAAAflA\/Bk25TZk1dyUhL9xTW13a7_KftE5-5T_swCLcBGAsYHQ\/s1600\/0_huebHCkGjCE0FpaB.png","title":"Apple strudel","publishedAt":"2018-04-10T00:00:00Z","nutrition":{"protein":"6 g","fat":"21 g","uom":"per 1 portion","carbohydrates":"50 g","calories":"1721 kJ \/ 411 kcal"},"usefulItems":"cling film, baking tray (approx. 40 cm x 35 cm), baking paper, tea towels, large tea towels (approx. 80 cm x 45 cm), rolling pin, pastry brush, scissors, oven","hintsAndTricks":["For a faster version, use ready-made strudel dough.","You can form two apple strudels instead of one large one: when placing filling on top of dough, leave a channel of a few cm clear in the middle of the row of apples. Roll the strudel as described in the recipe, then cut through the channel to form two strudels, pinching the ends of each strudel shut.","Serve with vanilla sauce, vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.","The breadcrumb and hazelnut mixture traps juices from the apples and keeps the strudel crust crisp. Instead of using both, you can use all breadcrumbs or all hazelnuts.","Before placing apples on breadcrumb mixture, check whether they have released a lot of juice.
