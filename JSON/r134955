A cold work surface (marble or stone) and a cool room temperature are helpful. If at any time during the process the dough feels warm, place in the freezer for 5 minutes before rolling out again. To prevent the dough from sticking to the work surface, whenever necessary use a light dusting of flour, or roll dough between two sheets of baking paper.","Puff pastry dough freezes very well before baking. Defrost in the fridge before using. Partially rolling out the dough before freezing allows for faster defrosting.","Once baked, pastry keeps well for up to 15 days when stored in an airtight container in a cool dry place.","To cook, roll dough into a rectangle (5 mm thick) and cut into required shape or shapes just before baking. Bake for 20 minutes (200°C) for one large piece of pastry, 12-15 minutes (200°C) for smaller pastries. Allow to cool on a wire rack before serving or storing in an airtight container until needed."],"basicInfo":["medium","20m","1h 20m","1 total recipe"]}
