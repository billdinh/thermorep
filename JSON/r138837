Serve cake within 1 day of completing recipe.","Make sure that your butter is softened to avoid lumps and air bubbles in your cake.","We recommend using soft, sifted icing sugar for this recipe.","This recipe makes 4 more cupcakes than needed. You can store cupcakes in the refrigerator or freezer, or make extra fondant and make more teacups.","If you are not using buttercream icing immediately, place into refrigerator until ready to use. To use, bring icing back to room temperature or stir until softened enough to spread.","Glycerine is an edible product and can be purchased from cake decorating shops or the health and beauty aisle in supermarkets.","Tylose is a vegetable gum, available from cake decorating supply stores; when added to fondant it makes it set more firmly. Use 1½-2 tsp tylose for every 500 g fondant, depending on the texture and moisture in your fondant.","Edible sugar glue can be purchased from cake decorating stores or online.","Fondant will keep for up to 2 months at room temperature. Liquid food colouring may affect the texture of your fondant and modelling paste; add sifted icing sugar as needed. Once your fondant or modelling paste is coloured, try to avoid excess use of icing sugar when rolling or modelling as this will leave white marks.","Always keep fondant\/modelling paste wrapped in plastic wrap inside a snap lock bag since it dries out quickly. Work quickly with modelling paste and keep excess in a sealed container while working with it."],"basicInfo":["advanced","3h","52h 50m","12 portions"]}
