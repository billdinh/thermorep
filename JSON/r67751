The indentation left by your finger should slowly disappear. If the dough springs up quickly more proving time is needed. If the indentation remains, the dough has been left to prove too long. The baguette will not rise as much during baking but the end result will taste the same.","Creating the burst of steam at the beginning of baking gives the baguettes their crisp, golden crust. Be very careful not to splash yourself or any glass elements in your oven. You can omit the step of creating the steam if desired.","Baguettes are always best eaten freshly baked.","Baguettes taste even better if you chill the dough overnight in the refrigerator. After the dough has proven in step 2, gently de-gas the dough by folding it over itself, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator. The next day proceed with step 3 as per recipe. The baguettes may need 10-20 minutes longer to prove in step 4 prior to baking."],"basicInfo":["advanced","30m","3h 45m","3 pieces"]}
