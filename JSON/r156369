Though made without oil or butter, the texture is very soft, thanks to the magic of steaming and the rich layer of sweet azuki bean paste. Azuki beans are small red beans that are frequently used in sweets and desserts in Asia. Refer to the variations if you have difficulty sourcing ingredients for this recipe.<\/i>","Azuki bean paste is cooked in three stages for the best possible flavour and texture. The first boiling eliminates bitter-tasting tannins and the second cooking ensures the beans soften fully before sugar is added in the final cooking stage.<br>- Azuki beans (also called adzuki or aduki beans), white rice flour and glutinous rice flour can be purchased in Asian or Japanese supermarkets.<br>- You can make the azuki bean paste in advance and chill it for up to <nobr>1 week,<\/nobr> or purchase it ready-made.","Replace azuki beans with dried red kidney beans.
