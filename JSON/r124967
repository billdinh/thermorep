Adding different flour combinations will result in various flavours and textures.","Depending on the environment and temperature, your starter may be ready from day 4.","Once your starter has fully fermented, store in the refrigerator (to \"put it to sleep\") or it will over-ferment and lose its rising ability. An over-fermented starter will have a noxious smell and may have mould on top. If this occurs, discard starter and start from step 1.","If you are planning to bake a loaf of sourdough from a \"sleepy\" starter, take the starter out of the refrigerator, feed it with 50 g flour and 70 g water and set aside in a warm place for 12 hours to re-activate (\"wake it up\").","You need to keep your starter alive by feeding it once a week.
