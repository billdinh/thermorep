Run dough through pasta machine with rollers set on most open setting; fold dough into thirds and roll it back through the pasta maker. If dough sticks, coat with a little more flour. Fold and roll the dough three more times on this setting.

Keep remaining dough covered to prevent from drying out. Repeat with remaining dough.","Fold pasta sheet in half lengthwise and press lightly.
