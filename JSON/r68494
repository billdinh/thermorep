For a fuller flavour use vintage cheddar, or for a more subtle flavour use a mild cheddar.","Asparagus, if in season, can be steamed for a few minutes in the Varoma dish while you cook the omelette. Remove asparagus once cooked to preference and proceed as per recipe."],"basicInfo":["medium","15m","30m","2 portions"]}
