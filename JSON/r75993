Extra chunks of cucumber can also be frozen. If using frozen pears or cucumber, use water instead of ice cubes, otherwise the smoothie would be very thick.","This smoothie is full of natural goodness to start your day well and keep you going. It's also a refreshing and nourishing snack before or after a workout. And the linseeds are a good source of Omega-3 essential fatty acids and protein.","Increase the watercress to 60-70 g for a peppery green taste.","Increase the pears to 500 g and freeze in lollipop moulds to make a great tasting (and healthy) summer treat.","If you don't have liquid minerals, replace with apple juice. Liquid plant-based minerals are excellent for adding extra nutritional value to smoothies.","Best served immediately, over ice cubes.","Can be covered and kept in the fridge for up to 24 hours."],"basicInfo":["easy","5m","10m","4 glasses"]}
