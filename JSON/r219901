Recommended minimum internal temperature is 165°F.","Halve the glaze recipe if only cooking 32 oz. of chicken wings.","Chicken wings can be placed into a zip lock bag with salt and pepper and oil and left overnight in the refrigerator to marinate longer.","This recipe is based on small wings. For large wings or whole pieces break up into smaller pieces and steam 15 minutes then turn over and steam a further 15 minutes before adding glaze and baking.","Grape jelly can have different amounts and types of sugar depending on the brand. The sugar aids in the caramelization process, make sure glaze is the consistency of honey before adding it to the wings. Extend cooking of glaze by five minute intervals until desired consistency is achieved."],"basicInfo":["medium","25m","1h 40m","8 portions"]}
