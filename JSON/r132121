For a smoky flavour, grill the marinated chicken on the barbecue.","We served ours with rice, you can serve with rice or bread of choice.","If you prefer your sauce to be a bit thinner, add an additional 30 g water when adding chicken to the mixing bowl.","If you do not want to grill your chicken, reduce yoghurt to 100 g and omit water from recipe.
