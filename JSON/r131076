Omit the meringue and use the lemon curd for filling and topping the cake.","Meringue frosting can be an everyday luxury. When you make it in the Thermomix, it only takes 10 minutes! Finish your cakes or desserts with this meringue frosting to make them extra special.","To make the cake using one tin, choose a high cake tin (Ø 18 cm) and pour in the whole amount of batter. Bake for 35-40 minutes in a preheated oven (180°C) and allow to cool for 10 minutes before removing from the cake tin. Cool completely on a wire rack, and simply slice in three horizontally before filling.","You can use the built-in Thermomix scales to measure out the exact quantity of cake batter for each cake tin. At the end of the recipe, turn the scales on, lift out mixing bowl and pour some cake batter into the prepared tin. When you return the mixing bowl to the base, it will show a minus figure indicating the weight removed (- 410 g).","The lemon cake can be made in advance: keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Or keep for up to 1 month in the freezer."],"basicInfo":["medium","45m","2h 10m","12 slices"]}
