If using roasted vegetables egg whites will only need 5 minutes cooking time.","Mixing bowl and butterfly whisk must be clean and dry before starting recipe.","To cook on stove top: place olive oil in a non-stick frying pan and heat to medium-low. Transfer whipped egg whites to frying pan and flatten to a circle (approx. 1 in. thick) ensuring edges of egg whites are not touching edges of frying pan. Make identations into the egg white clouds with the back of the spoon and carefully add a yolk into it. Cover frying pan with lid and cook for 5-8 minutes, until the egg whites are lightly golden and egg yolks are cooked to your liking. If the egg whites stick to the frying pan lid use a silicone spatula to gently slide around inside edge to dislodge.","For runny eggs: precook clouds for 3 minutes, then add yolks and cook a further 3 minutes."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","20m","4 portions"]}
