Before using, bring the icing back to room temperature or stir until soft enough to spread or pipe.","Glycerine is an edible product and can be purchased from cake decorating shops or the health and beauty aisle in most supermarkets.","Liquid food colouring may affect the texture of your fondant; add sifted icing sugar as needed. Once your fondant or modelling paste is coloured, try to avoid excess use of icing sugar when rolling or modelling as this will leave white marks. We recommend natural food colouring gel when possible.","If your fondant feels dry and cracked, feels very firm or crumbly, knead in a few drops of glycerine or a few drops of cooled boiled water to soften and make it more elastic. This will help avoid cracks in the finished product. You can also rub some vegetable shortening (Copha) onto your palms and work surface and continue to knead.","Fondant can be stored for up to 2 months at room temperature. Fondant can be frozen for up to 1 month; simply bring back to room temperature before using.","To make stitching detail on cap and peak, use a piece of string to create 8 sections in the cap (string will make indented lines). Then use a design\/quilting tool (available at cake decorating stores or online) and make indents on either side of the string markings."],"basicInfo":["medium","1h 30m","3h 45m","12 portions"]}
