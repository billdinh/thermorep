Add oil and bring to 175°C (to check your oil is at 175°C, use a kitchen thermometer or drop a small cube of bread in the oil. It should turn golden in 15-20 seconds). Keep your oil at this temperature while frying (175°C). Working in batches, carefully place 5-6 spring rolls into oil and fry for 5 minutes or until golden in colour. Keep rolls separated during first minute of frying to prevent sticking. Using a slotted spoon, transfer onto prepared plate to drain. Serve warm (see Tips)."}],"usefulItems":"bowl, baking tray (30 x 40 cm), baking paper, kitchen towel, pastry brush, kitchen thermometer, 1 plate, paper towel, large saucepan, slotted spoon, stove top","id":"r138001","imageLink":"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-hT4IAEwtwgk\/XZaq1Fjph4I\/AAAAAAAAhhY\/pYtfXo77ibEButEzhWJVC8YwwUTuLTpewCLcBGAsYHQ\/s1600\/0_pu_g8sBMAj-pXdL3.png","title":"Cha gio (spring rolls)","ingredients":[{"isHeader":true,"content":"Ingredients"},{"isHeader":false,"content":"50 g bean thread vermicelli noodles"},{"isHeader":false,"content":"10 g dried shiitake mushrooms, cut into pieces"},{"isHeader":false,"content":"boiling water, for soaking"},{"isHeader":false,"content":"30 g eschalot, cut into pieces"},{"isHeader":false,"content":"2 garlic cloves"},{"isHeader":false,"content":"5 sprigs fresh coriander, leaves and stems, torn into pieces"},{"isHeader":false,"content":"100 g carrot, cut into pieces (3-4 cm)"},{"isHeader":false,"content":"500 g pork mince"},{"isHeader":false,"content":"1 tsp salt"},{"isHeader":false,"content":"¼ tsp ground black pepper"},{"isHeader":false,"content":"1 tbsp soy sauce"},{"isHeader":false,"content":"18 spring roll pastry sheets"},{"isHeader":false,"content":"water, for brushing"},{"isHeader":false,"content":"vegetable oil, for frying"}],"nutrition":["per 1 portion","1124 kJ \/ 267 kcal","6.9 g","8.7 g","23 g"],"hintsAndTricks":["Serve with Nuoc cham dipping sauce or cut into halves and serve on top of the meatball salad (refer to the recipes in this collection).","You can replace the pork mince with chicken mince.","You can find spring roll pastry sheets in the frozen food aisle of most major supermarkets."],"basicInfo":["medium","40m","55m","18 portions"]}
