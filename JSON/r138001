Add oil and bring to 175°C (to check your oil is at 175°C, use a kitchen thermometer or drop a small cube of bread in the oil. It should turn golden in 15-20 seconds). Keep your oil at this temperature while frying (175°C). Working in batches, carefully place 5-6 spring rolls into oil and fry for 5 minutes or until golden in colour. Keep rolls separated during first minute of frying to prevent sticking. Using a slotted spoon, transfer onto prepared plate to drain.
