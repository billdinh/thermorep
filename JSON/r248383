Cook ahead then keep in the fridge until assembly.","Serve with crusty bread to soak up any herby butter remaining in the shells.","The quantity of mussels in the Varoma can be increased, so long as the lid of the Varoma closes properly. Adding more mussels may increase the cooking time. You can remove mussels that have opened, and continue cooking until all mussels have opened, discarding any that remain closed at the end of cooking.","The basil butter works well with scallops in the half shell too.","Instead of baking the mussels on the half shells, toss them and the basil butter through some freshly cooked pasta such as papardelle."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","40m","4 portions"]}
