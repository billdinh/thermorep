Fish and shellfish should marinate for only 30 minutes to an hour; any longer and the flesh might start to “cook” and become mushy.","Serve with rice, beans and plenty of lime wedges.","Wash lemons and all vegetables not to be peeled.","The sauce and shredded cabbage can be made ahead and refrigerated until needed. Store sauce in an airtight jar. For the cabbage, place in a bowl and cover with a wet paper towel to prevent from drying out."],"basicInfo":["easy","25m","45m","6 portions"]}
