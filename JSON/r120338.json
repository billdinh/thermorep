Cut a lid from the pumpkin and scoop out seeds.  Immerse pumpkin into boiling water (top up with water as needed to cover) for 5-10 minutes, then carefully transfer pumpkin into a large container of cold water to stop cooking. Place the pumpkin upside down on a wire rack to drain. To serve, fill the pumpkin with soup, garnish with bacon and sour cream and serve immediately. The pumpkin flesh will not be cooked enough to eat and should only be used for decorative purposes."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","45m","4 portions"]}
