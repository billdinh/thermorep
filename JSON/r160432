Add food coloring until desired color is achieved after inserting butterfly whisk and beat with cooled gelatin mixture.","Replace confectioners sugar mixture with toasted coconut to coat marshmallows. Sprinkle coconut on a baking sheet and bake for 10-15 minutes (350째F), stirring coconut every 5 minutes to ensure even baking. Alternatively, toast in a large heavy based frying pan, shaking pan continually so coconut does not burn. Roll marshmallow cubes in slightly cooled toasted coconut."],"basicInfo":["medium","20m","2h","1"]}
