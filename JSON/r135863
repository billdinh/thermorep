You can find them at gourmet food stores or online. <br>","Asafoetida comes from the root of a perennial Indian herb. It has a strong odour, but the aroma softens as it cooks, and it tastes similar to onion and garlic, enhancing the savoury flavour of the dish. It helps reduce flatulence and constipation, and reduce the growth of microflora in the gut. A little goes a long way, so you only need to use a small amount.","Chaat Masala can be sprinkled over green salads, fruit salads and added to raita for an extra burst of flavour. Sprinkle a few pinches of Chaat Masala over cooked dishes, allow to sit for 2-3 minutes, then serve. Adding the spice just before serving brings out the flavours of the dish.","Store Chaat masala in a sealable storage container in a cool, dark place for up to 6 months."],"basicInfo":["easy","5m","10m","1 total recipe"]}
