Transfer dough onto a lightly floured silicone bread mat or plastic wrap and shape into a ball. Wrap and place into refrigerater to rest for 30 minutes.","Using silicone bread mat or floured work surface, roll out dough into a rectangle (35 cm wide x 25 cm long, approx. 1 cm thick). Cut rectangle vertically into 4 cm wide strips, then cut each strip horizontally into 7 cm lengths (creating approx. 30 small rectangles in total). Leaving a 1½ cm edge at top end of each piece, make 2 vertical cuts to form 3 even strips. Plait strips, securing ends together by pinching tightly. Place onto a plate and cover with a kitchen towel.","Place a large saucepan over medium heat, add oil and heat oil to 170°C. To test temperature of the oil, use a candy thermometer or drop a small piece of dough into oil; the oil is at 170°C when dough rises to the surface immediately and bubbles gently form around dough.","Remove cold syrup from refrigerator. Carefully drop 4-6 koeksisters into hot oil and fry for 3-5 minutes each side or until golden brown. Carefully remove koeksisters using a large slotted spoon and immediately dip into cold syrup for 30 seconds. Transfer koeksisters to a serving dish and set aside. Repeat frying and dipping with remaining koeksisters. Serve immediately.
