It has a strong odour, but the aroma softens as it cooks, and it tastes similar to onion and garlic, enhancing the savoury flavour of the dish. It helps reduce flatulence and constipation, and reduce the growth of microflora in the gut. A little goes a long way, so you only need to use a small amount. You can find asafoetida at Indian grocers or online.","Serve alongside your favourite Indian curries or mains. We served ours with rice."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","50m","4 portions"]}
