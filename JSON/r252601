During this time artichokes take over restaurant menus, often prepared in one of two ways; carciofi alla giudìa, deep-fried, or carciofi alla romana, stuffed and braised. Here artichokes are combined with flavourful olives to make a beautiful rustic tart which would make a stunning centrepiece for lunch or dinner.","To make this recipe suitable for vegetarians, substitute the Parmesan cheese for a vegetarian hard cheese."],"basicInfo":["medium","30m","1h 20m","8 slices"]}
