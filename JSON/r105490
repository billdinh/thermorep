Wash fruit before using.","Cooking time will vary depending on moisture content of your apples.","Apple purée will thicken and is ready when a sample is put on a cold plate and is the consistency of room temperature butter.","To ensure preservation, clean jars thoroughly in hot soapy water. Rinse by pouring boiling water over them. Prepare for filling by placing clean jars in a baking pan and heat in oven (212°F) until required. Pour Apple Butter into jars while jars are still warm and proceed as directed by the recipe.","Once opened, Apple Butter will keep in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. Alternatively, store in plastic containers or ice cube trays and freeze.","Spread on toast or scones or use as a filling for cakes and tarts. Also may be mixed with an equal amount of softly whipped cream and served with cookies for dessert."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","1h 30m","1"]}
