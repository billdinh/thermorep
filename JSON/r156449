Heat oven to 375°F.

Place Varoma tray on top of parchment and cut around the tray to form an oval shape.","Canned diced tomatoes can be replaced with fresh tomatoes (stems removed and cut in half). Chop tomatoes <b><strong>10 sec\/speed 9<\/strong><b> for smooth version or <b><strong>5 secs\/speed 5<\/strong><b> for chunky version. Continue with recipe steps. Canned diced tomatoes give a chunky texture and fresh will give a smoother textured sauce.","When adding spices, add extra spices for more flavor; e.g. 1\/2 tsp of turmeric powder, 1 tsp of smoked paprika when adding other spices.","Grind your own peppercorns and cumin seeds.
