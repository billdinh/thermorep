Leave at room temperature for a few minutes, and tap them with a rolling pin to make them more pliable.","Instead of rolling pastry between two sheets of parchment, roll it out on a lightly floured surface, and carry the pastry to the pie pan using the rolling pin."],"basicInfo":["medium","30m","3h 30m","8 slices"]}
