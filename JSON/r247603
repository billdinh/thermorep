Traditionally made using ricotta, these dumplings are light, delicate, and probably unlike anything you’ve had before. This recipe isn’t a quick one but don’t be put off by the timings; the gnudi need to sit in a coating of semolina for at least <b>8 hours,<b> during which time the semolina forms a thin shell around the ricotta that helps keep them intact during cooking. The result? Soft pillows of ricotta gently flavoured with Parmesan that simply melt in the mouth.","Use Thermomix ground nutmeg for the best flavour. Place <b>3-10 whole<b> nutmegs in mixing bowl then grind <strong>30 sec\/speed 10<\/strong> or until fine.","To make this recipe suitable for vegetarians, substitute the Parmesan cheese for a vegetarian hard cheese."],"basicInfo":["advanced","35m","20h 45m","6 portions"]}
