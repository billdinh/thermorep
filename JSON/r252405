The starter is ready when it's increased in size and looks aerated (you can see small bubbles). In warmer climates, it might take less than 3 days for starter to be ready (we suggest checking once each day). The starter has not fermented properly if it's hard or firm all the way through (it may have a hard crust on top, but that can be removed and starter underneath used).","Use leftover starter to make another loaf. You can store the starter in the refrigerator for up to 2 days."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","74h","12 portions"]}
