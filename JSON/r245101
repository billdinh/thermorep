The first ice cream cone was produced in 1896 by an Italian immigrant in New York, and the idea of eating frozen desserts out of a cone-shaped waffle soon caught on. In 1959, an ice cream manufacturer based in Naples came up with a way to sell frozen, ready-made ice cream cones by pouring a mixture of oil, sugar and chocolate into the inside of the waffle cone to protect it and prevent it turning soggy. Our take on the mass-produced Cornetto is a real crowd-pleaser - your friends and family won’t believe you’ve made them yourself!"],"basicInfo":["advanced","30m","15h","9 portions"]}
