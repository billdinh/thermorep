Pour apple butter into jars while jars are still warm and proceed as directed by the recipe.","Once opened, apple butter will keep in the fridge for up to <b>2 weeks.<b> Alternatively, store in freezer-proof containers or ice cube trays and freeze.","Spread on toast or scones or use as a filling for cakes and tarts.
