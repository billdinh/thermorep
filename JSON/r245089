Biscotti have been around for many years and were often eaten by sailors who were at sea for months at a time – the thorough baking helps to draw out moisture, making them extremely long-lasting and resistant to mould. Today, Italians generally serve biscotti after dinner, accompanied by a vin santo wine. Outside of Italy, the biscuits, which are made with various flavour combinations, are typically served with a coffee."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","3h 40m","30 pieces"]}
