The steaming time may need to be increased by <b>5-10 minutes<b> if the containers are not metal, or are larger than <b>110 ml<b> each.<br>- Puddings with sticky toffee sauce can also be served with pouring cream or ice cream.<br>- The sauce makes approx. <b>200 ml.<b> To double it, double all sauce ingredients and cook with same timings. Extra sauce keeps well in a sterilised jar in the refrigerator for up to <b>3 months,<b> and if it separates when cold, stir before using.","<i>There is nothing more quintessentially British than a good old-fashioned sticky toffee pudding. With your Thermomix, it's easy to make and steam the puddings and it only takes a few minutes to make a gorgeous sticky toffee sauce. If you can find dark brown sugar, soft brown sugar and golden syrup, they will give you the most authentic flavours. However any type of brown sugar can be used and honey or maple syrup make a nice substitute for golden syrup.<\/i>","Raisins can be used instead of dates.<br>- Steam as one large pudding in a deep <b> 20 cm)<b> springform tin lined with greased baking paper on the base, making sure some holes remain unobstructed so steam can circulate (placing a steaming rack or chopsticks on the bottom of the Varoma dish will raise the tin off the holes). Steam <b><strong>40-45 min\/Varoma\/speed 1<\/strong><b> or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the pudding comes out clean."],"basicInfo":["medium","25m","1h","8 portions"]}
