With your Thermomix, it's easy to make and steam the puddings and it only takes a few minutes to make a gorgeous sticky toffee sauce. If you can find dark brown sugar, soft brown sugar and golden syrup, they will give you the most authentic flavours. However any type of brown sugar can be used and honey or maple syrup make a nice substitute for golden syrup.<\/i>","Raisins can be used instead of dates.<br>- Steam as one large pudding in a deep <b> 20 cm)<b> springform tin lined with greased baking paper on the base, making sure some holes remain unobstructed so steam can circulate (placing a steaming rack or chopsticks on the bottom of the Varoma dish will raise the tin off the holes).
