Ancient gnocchi were made from a semolina porridge-like dough that was mixed with eggs, variations of which are still eaten today. Gnocchi made from potato is a fairly recent discovery, occurring after the introduction of potatoes to Europe in the 16th century. In this recipe we’ve used sweet potatoes to add an extra level of flavour and colour as well as complementing the decadent Gorgonzola sauce perfectly.","Shaped gnocchi can be frozen before being cooked, then boiled straight from frozen. Freeze in a single layer on a baking tray, then transfer to a freezer bag and keep frozen until needed.","To make this recipe suitable for vegetarians, substitute the Parmesan cheese for a vegetarian hard cheese and Gorgonzola for a vegetarian blue cheese."],"basicInfo":["medium","45m","1h 35m","6 portions"]}
