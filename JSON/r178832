Or serve it on its own or with a dusting of icing sugar.","Cake texture is at its best when consumed within one day. To prevent sponge cake from drying out, store in a container in the fridge. Sponge cake will keep for <b>4-5 days<b> in the fridge or up to <b>1 month<b> in the freezer.","This is a basic and versatile recipe that can be layered and sandwiched with fillings. It is perfect as a simple, everyday cake, or you can make it into a celebration cake by icing and decorating in a more elaborate way. The batter for this low-fat sponge is whisked at 37°C, creating a light and airy sponge. Alternatively, bake this cake as a sheet to use for Swiss rolls or layered mousse cakes.","Sugar has an impact on the cake's texture. For a very light and fluffy texture, use <b>120 g sugar.<b>","<strong>Chocolate Sponge Cake<\/strong>: use only <b>80 g flour<b> and add <b>40 g cocoa<b> powder.","<strong>Rolled Cake:<\/strong> bake the sponge cake in a Swiss roll tin for use in jam rolls, Swiss rolls, etc. Transfer cake batter to a baking tray lined with baking paper or a silicone mat. Spread batter into a rectangle <b>(40 x 30 cm)<b> and bake immediately for <b>8 minutes<b> (180°C). Roll cake while it is still hot with the help of a clean tea towel.
