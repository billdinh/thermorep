They are essentially a circle of pizza dough stuffed with fillings then folded in half before being baked in a pizza oven. Fillings vary from meats, cheeses and vegetables, and traditionally do not contain tomato sauce. Instead, a small dish of tomato sauce is served on the side. Our recipe makes calzones with two different fillings. The ingredients can be doubled for either filling to make four calzones the same."],"basicInfo":["medium","25m","1h 30m","4 portions"]}
