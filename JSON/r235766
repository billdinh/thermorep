Wet polenta is spread over a special wooden board in the middle of the table and topped with a rich, meaty stew. Families sit around the board and simply tuck into the stew with their forks, making it a very sociable way of dining. Our stew is based on a Tuscan ‘<i>sottiglia<\/i>’ and can be made with whatever meats you have on hand. Serve on plates, or why not try the traditional way of pouring it out onto a board or table!"],"basicInfo":["medium","10m","1h 40m","8 portions"]}
