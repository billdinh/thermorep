Soaking oats improves the digestibility and helps break down phytic acid, which interferes with nutrient absorption.","You can use kefir milk, thick Greek yoghurt or coconut yoghurt in this recipe. Kefir is typically the richest source of probiotics.","The dates give this banana thickshake a natural caramel flavour.","This thickshake is sweet enough for most palates. If your children like a fraction more added sweetness, add 1 teaspoon honey or maple syrup with the banana (only suitable for children over 1 year). However, youâ€™ll generally only need this if the banana is not fully ripe and naturally sweet."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","24h 10m","2 glasses"]}
