We recommend darker miso in this recipe.","Miso will keep for a long time in a sealable container.  Try using any leftover in other sauces, marinades, stocks, stews, braises or soups for added flavour and nutrients.","Marinate your chicken overnight for a quick and tasty Japanese-inspired meal."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","1h 30m","2 portions"]}
