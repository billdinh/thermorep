Two cans of black beans will be enough, with some left over to add to salads or soups. If using canned beans, omit the steps regarding soaking and cooking your beans. However, dried beans are the best option if you wish to avoid possible toxic chemicals (such as bisphenol A) sometimes found in the lining of cans.","You can replace the coconut sugar with Rapadura sugar in this recipe.","For a milder flavour, use dark chocolate with a lower cocoa content (but be aware that it will probably contain more sugar).","If you prefer, you can replace the raw cacao powder with regular cocoa powder."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","25h 20m","16 portions"]}
