He tried to patent the recipe in 1981, but it's been copied and developed by countless famous chefs over the years, including Jean-George Vongerichten (who also claims it as his own), Raymond Blanc and Gordon Ramsay. This recipe borrows from the classic, with a little Nigella inspiration too."],"basicInfo":["medium","20m","55m","8 portions"]}
