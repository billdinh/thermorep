Wrap rolls in cling film and leave in a cool dry place then slice just before serving.","Sushi can be wrapped in cling film and refrigerated.

This ensures the fish has been frozen at extremely low temperatures to get rid of parasites making it safe to eat raw."],"basicInfo":["medium","30m","1h 20m","36 pieces"]}
