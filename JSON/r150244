Do not open jar during fermentation as this can introduce bacteria and spoil the contents. If it smells sour or has mould growing on it, the fermentation was not successful. Discard immediately and start recipe from the beginning.","Ensure contents are submerged - any uncovered vegetables may rot if not covered completely.","Always use clean utensils when serving from the jar so bacteria isn't introduced.","Fermented vegetables can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 year."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","72h","1 total recipe"]}
