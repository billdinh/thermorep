References to ravioli date back to 16th century Rome, and they remain a staple of Italian cuisine today. Ravioli are served either in a thin broth as a starter, or with pasta sauce as a main. Traditional Italian fillings include ricotta mixed with grated cheese and spinach, or mixed meat and vegetables. As with many recipes, location has a bearing on the dish, with seafood ravioli such as this one popular in the coastal regions."],"basicInfo":["advanced","1h","2h","8 portions"]}
