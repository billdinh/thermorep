If lentils are not yet tender after cooking, set Varoma aside, add <b>100 g water<b> and cook <b><strong>5 min\/100°C\/\/speed 1,<\/strong><b> then, if needed, add another <b>100 g water<b> and repeat.<br>- When cooking for children, use only <b>¼ tsp cayenne<b> pepper, and serve with Greek yoghurt for a cooling effect.<br>- To open a fresh coconut easily, heat it <b>5-7 minutes<b> in a preheated oven (220-240°C) then remove from oven and carefully hit it with a hammer - the shell will crack easily because it will have expanded slightly from the coconut flesh. Cut coconut flesh into <b>3 cm pieces<b> - no need to peel off the thin brown skin for this recipe. Extra coconut pieces can be frozen for up to <b>3 months.<b>","If you prefer more of a dahl texture, blend the curried lentils <b><strong>20 sec\/speed 6<\/strong><b> after cooking.<br>- Use diced fresh red capsicums instead of roasted preserved. This adds a lovely fresh crunch to the curried lentils.<br>- Replace butter with coconut oil and crème fraîche with coconut cream."],"basicInfo":["easy","35m","1h 15m","8 portions"]}
