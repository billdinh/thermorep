Cover with a kitchen towel and keep covered while working with dough. Using a rolling pin, roll out each dough portion into a square shape (approx. 8 x 8 cm, 3 mm thickness). Place 1 tablespoon of the lamb mixture into the middle of the dough square and flatten slightly.

It's available in Middle Eastern delicatessens or specialty spice stores. If you can't find it, try combining 1 tbsp mild paprika with 1 tsp cayenne powder instead. Or you can replace the Aleppo pepper with dried chilli flakes in this recipe.","These sfiha are shaped like square open pastry parcels with pinched corners to hold the filling in place."],"basicInfo":["easy","30m","1h 20m","28 portions"]}
