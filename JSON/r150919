The portions for six are very generous, and you can easily serve up to ten people if you add a salad or two to the menu.<\/i>","Add pistachios and\/or pomegranate seeds as extra garnishes.<br>- Replace half or all the couscous with quinoa for a slightly nutty flavour and a higher protein content."],"basicInfo":["medium","45m","1h 15m","6 portions"]}
