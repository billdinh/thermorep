Given the spiciness of this pizza, it’s a well-suited name! We’ve used spicy salami in our version, but for a really devilish pizza we recommend adding some 'nduja sausage. 'Nduja is an extremely spicy, pork salami, similar to the French andouille sausage, which was introduced to the Calabrian region of Italy in the 13th century. The spreadable salami gets its fiery taste from roasted hot red peppers and is traditionally eaten spread on bread or alongside cheese.","Lightly grease cling film to prevent it from sticking to the dough during the resting and leavening stages.","There is no need to line non-stick pizza trays.","Cooking time may be reduced on a thinner pizza tray or one with holes in.","Cook pizzas in batches or use normal baking trays if you don't own <b>3 pizza<b> trays.","For a strong spicy taste, you can add some 'nduja crumbled over the surface of the pizza before baking."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","1h 30m","3 portions"]}
