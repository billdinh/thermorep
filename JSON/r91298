The mixing bowl and butterfly whisk must be absolutely clean and free of any fatty residues.","To make your own liquid caramel, melt 7 oz sugar with 2 tbsp water and 2 tsp lemon juice in a medium-size, very clean saucepan over medium-high heat. Do not stir, but occasionally swirl the saucepan, until sugar becomes a fairly dark amber. At this point, very carefully pour in (approx. 3.5 oz) hot water (it will bubble up and spatter). Stir over medium heat until all caramel is dissolved and syrup thickens slightly. This syrup will keep for weeks refrigerated in a sealed jar.","Instead of caramel or chopped pistachios, sprinkle with any chopped nuts, preferably toasted, with crushed praline, or with chocolate flakes."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","40m","6 portions"]}
