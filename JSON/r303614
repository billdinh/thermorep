Transfer dough onto a lightly floured work surface and divide dough into 4 equal portions, then divide each portion into 10 pieces (approx. 15 g each). Shape each piece into a ball, then roll out into a disc (approx. 10 cm), keeping dough thicker in the middle and thinner on the edges.

Simply place into Varoma and steam for 15-17 minutes, as per recipe.","These dumplings are fragile once cooked as the filling is liquid, so take cake when serving."],"basicInfo":["advanced","1h","26h 50m","40 portions"]}
