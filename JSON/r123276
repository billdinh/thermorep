The wholemeal adds a fibre boost to these biscuits.","If you prefer, you can use regular cocoa powder in place of the raw cacao.","You can use your preferred brown sugar in this recipe - either regular brown sugar or a less refined option such as Rapadura sugar (Panela) or coconut sugar.","Many commercial jams are at least half sugar. Cut down on the sweetness by making your own with minimal sugar such as Berry chia jam (please refer to the recipe on this recipe chip) or try to find a brand with a higher fruit content. Some quality jams are available with 70 per cent fruit - check the label so you know what you‘re getting."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","5h 10m","20 portions"]}
