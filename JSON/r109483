It's popular in many regions of India as well as other countries such as Sri Lanka and Nepal.","You can buy split black lentils (urad dal) at Indian food stores, some health food stores, some bulk food stores and online.","To make cooked rice, place 700 g water into mixing bowl, insert simmering basket and weigh rice into it and cook <strong>14 min\/100°C\/speed 4. <\/strong>Or use leftover rice.","In hot weather, the batter mixture will rise quite quickly, but in the cooler months you may want to place the mixture in a warm area to assist with the fermenting process. The batter will increase in size, become frothy with little bubbles and may have a \"yeast\" aroma when fermented properly.","If your batter is too thick, add a little water until batter is the consistency of pouring (whipping) cream."],"basicInfo":["medium","1h","28h 40m","6 portions"]}
