Before using, bring the icing back to room temperature or stir until soft enough to spread.","Glycerine is an edible product and can be purchased from cake decorating shops or the health and beauty aisle in most supermarkets.","Liquid food colouring may affect the texture of your fondant; add sifted icing sugar as needed. Once your fondant is coloured, try to avoid excess use of icing sugar when rolling as this will leave white marks. We recommend natural food colouring gel when possible.","If your fondant feels dry and cracked, feels very firm or crumbly, knead in a few drops of glycerine or a few drops of cooled boiled water to soften and make it more elastic. This will help avoid cracks in the finished product. You can also rub some vegetable shortening (Copha) onto your palms and work surface and continue to knead.","A Dolly Varden doll has the upper half of a doll's body and the lower half is a skewer.","Get creative with this cake! You can use any colour in your fondant (or divide the fondant into portions and use a different colour for each portion), any size or shape of cookie cutter, or simply create a smooth gown (without cutting out shapes) by draping fondant over the cake."],"basicInfo":["medium","1h 30m","2h 20m","12 portions"]}
