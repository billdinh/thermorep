Place the bowl with melted chocolate on mixing bowl lid and stir with spatula for 2-5 seconds, as needed, to keep chocolate tempered.","For best results: look for chocolate with high cocoa solids. Cocoa or some derivative, such as cocoa butter should be the primary ingredient.  Quality chocolate will have a matte gloss finish and smooth texture that is free of discoloration. Dark chocolate should make a snapping sound when broken without crumbling while white and milk chocolate should bend rather than snap."],"basicInfo":["easy","30m","45m","70 pieces"]}
