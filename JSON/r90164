They give a fresh exotic flavour to this not overly-sweet dessert and steaming provides the dreamy texture. An added benefit is that you can make them up to 2 days ahead and have them ready in the fridge as an easy and elegant dessert. However, make sure the family knows you are saving them, otherwise they might well disappear as they are quite irresistible!","These cheesecakes can be steamed in other small dishes or containers, e.g. dariole moulds, espresso cups, glasses, verrines or silicone muffin cups, provided they are heat-resistant. The steaming time may have to be increased by <b>5-10 minutes<b> if the containers are larger than those recommended in the recipe. If using ramekins or moulds no taller than <b>4 cm,<b> place them in both the Varoma dish and tray as described in the recipe. If using taller moulds, place in Varoma dish only, and if they don’t all fit, steam them in <b>2 batches,<b> adding water as needed to mixing bowl.","Make pistachio cheesecakes ahead of time and keep refrigerated for <b>1-2 days.<b>","Instead of diced mango serve the cheesecakes with mango coulis: place <b>250 g fresh<b> mango, cut in pieces, <b>75 g sugar<b> and <b>15 g lime<b> (or lemon) juice in mixing bowl and blend <b><b>30 sec\/speed 5-10,<b><b> <b>increasing speed gradually.<b> Scrape down sides of mixing bowl using spatula. Cook <b><b>5 min\/90°C\/speed 2.<b><b> Allow sauce to cool before drizzling <b>1-2 tbsp<b> over or beside each cheesecake.","Garnish with seasonal fruit of choice if mangoes are not in season. Frozen mango can be used as well; simply allow to thaw before dicing."],"basicInfo":["medium","35m","2h 30m","6 portions"]}
