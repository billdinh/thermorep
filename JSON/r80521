The thyme butter sauce melts on its own in the Varoma while the green bean bundles and potatoes steam. This dish can also be served as a lighter meal on its own, with a simple salad.","For a vegetarian version, omit bacon and use spring onion greens or chives to tie the green bean bundles.","Serve a cream and chive sauce drizzled over the potatoes instead of the thyme butter.","Add some chopped garlic to the thyme butter before steaming."],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","50m","4 portions"]}
