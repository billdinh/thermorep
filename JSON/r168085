Place dough onto a damp kitchen towel, cover phyllo with a damp cloth while assembling the baklava to keep it from drying out.","To make diamond shapes: make a diagonal cut from one corner of the pan to the opposite corner with a sharp knife. Continue making diagonal cuts parallel to the first line. Then make lengthwise cuts parallel to the long edge of the pan at regular intervals to form a diamond pattern.","Number of portions can be doubled: cut 24 pieces for more and smaller servings.","Use a light flavored honey."],"basicInfo":["medium","2h","3h","12 portions"]}
