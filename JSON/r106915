Discard any clams with broken shells as the clam may be dead or unhealthy. Completely submerge clams in a bowl of cool, fresh water, then cover with a damp kitchen towel and refrigerate for approximately 20 minutes. As the clams are soaking they will naturally purge any salt, sand and particles. Drain clams, refresh water and submerge clams again. You can repeat this process 2-3 times if desired to ensure the clams are thoroughly purged. Once purged, scrub off any barnacles, sand or other debris which may be on clam shells.<br>(Purchasing 32 oz of mussels leaves room for bad mussels to be removed, minimum amount required 26.5 oz. For clams, minimum amount required 16 oz.)"],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","30m","4 portions"]}
