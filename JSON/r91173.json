Freeze dough partially rolled out for faster defrosting in the refrigerator.","To blind bake a crust or pie shell, use a rolling pin to roll out pastry on a lightly floured surface. Line a greased quiche or pie pan with the pastry and prick with a fork to avoid air bubbles. Line pastry with parchment and fill with baking weights (e.g. rice, beans) before baking in a preheated oven (350°F) for 15 minutes. Remove parchment and baking weights and bake for a further 5 minutes or until golden brown."],"basicInfo":["easy","5m","5m","1"]}
