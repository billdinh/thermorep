This is the perfect meal to serve if you have several mouths to feed; baked in the oven for an hour you can simply bring the dish straight to the table. It is a hearty meal on cold winter nights and can be eaten with a raita and\/or pickle (see recipes) or just as is."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","1h 30m","6 portions"]}
