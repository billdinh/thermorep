It's great as an addition to cheese platters or in sandwiches with cold meats, cheeses or roasted vegetables. You can also use it to add spice and texture to marinades or sauces.","The spiciness of the jelly depends on the strength of your chillies, which can vary significantly depending on where they are from and when they are picked. The chilli heat of the jelly will intensify as it cooks, so taste as you go and adjust to your preference.","If you prefer a less spicy version, deseed some or all of your chillies and proceed as per recipe.","If you prefer a less sweet version, reduce the sugar content to 600 g and proceed as per recipe.","The chilli and vinegar in this recipe create strong vapours while cooking. It is recommended that the cooking area is well-ventilated by opening a window or using an extraction fan.","This jelly does not have a firm set; if you prefer your jelly to have a firmer set, store in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours before serving."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","4h 15m","4 jars"]}
