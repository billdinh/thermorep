We recommend making your own Mayonnaise in the Thermomix to use in this recipe (see <em>The Basic Cookbook<\/em> or <em>Everyday Cookbook<\/em> for recipe).","This is a quick and delicious dip, perfect for last minute entertaining when you want something a little more satifying to serve with drinks. Serve warm with crackers or toasted ciabatta slices to dip or allow to cool to room temperature, then cover and place into the refrigerator to chill. Once chilled and firm, serve as an alternative to the salmon mousse in the center of the<em> Gourgère puffs<\/em>.","The oil from the artichokes and mayonnaise will release during baking. If there is excess oil on top, dab carefully with a piece of paper towel to soak it up prior to serving."],"basicInfo":["easy","5m","35m","420 gram"]}
