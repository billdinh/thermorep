It ensures a smooth finish as it seals in any stray crumbs.","You can bake and decorate the cake in an ombre style, using different shades of one colour, or you can use different colours for a rainbow sponge and icing.","For a rainbow icing; after applying crumb layer, divide remaining icing between five bowls then colour each bowl a different colour."],"basicInfo":["advanced","50m","2h 10m","12 slices"]}
