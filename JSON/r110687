Homemade, it contains a far more intense flavour as grinding the spices with sugar in your Thermomix is a great way to release the oils and aromas. Left to mature for a few weeks before using will only improve the flavour.","Once opened, the chutney should be stored in the fridge."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","50m","1 total recipe"]}
