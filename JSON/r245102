Nowadays gelato forms a huge part of Italian culture, with more than 5,000 ice cream parlours across the country! Similar to ice cream, gelato is made with a base of milk, cream and sugar, then flavoured with fruit and nut purées as well as other flavourings. A subtle difference between ice cream and gelato is that the latter is typically made using less cream, if any. Gelato is also generally richer and more dense because it is churned at a slower speed."],"basicInfo":["easy","10m","9h 25m","8 portions"]}
