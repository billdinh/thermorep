Similar to a pizza it can be sliced or folded, and it can either be served for breakfast or lunch. The most popular form of manaeesh uses zaatar as a topping. The zaatar is mixed with olive oil and spread onto the bread before baking it in the oven. It is a popular breakfast in Levantine cuisine.","Zaatar is an aromatic Middle Eastern seasoning mixture that usually contains ground dried thyme, oregano, marjoram, mixed with toasted sesame seeds, and salt. It's a very versatile flavouring, and can be added to rice dishes, or rubbed into meat and fish before grilling, as well as vegetable dishes.","To make your own zaatar at home mix in a small bowl 2 tbsp dried thyme, 1 tbsp oregano, 2 tsp sumac, 2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds and ½ tsp salt. Add a ¼ tsp of dried chilli if you like some heat.","This yoghurt sauce complements the flatbread very well: mix in a bowl 100 g Greek yoghurt, juice of ½ of a lemon, 8 chopped mint leaves, ½ tsp salt and ¼ tsp ground pepper."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","3h 20m","20 pieces"]}
