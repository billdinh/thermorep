Cooking several ingredients at the same time using the different levels of the Thermomix is a great time-saver and makes this salad a dish that can be enjoyed any time.<\/i>","In <b>step 5,<b> if you are in a hurry to cool the vegetables, run cold water over each vegetable separately while they are still in the Varoma dish, Varoma tray and simmering basket.<br>- For a traditional Russian flavour, omit the vinegar.","For a creamy pink version of the salad, instead of making the vinaigrette in <b>step 7,<b> dress the cooled vegetables with sour cream or mayonnaise (quantity to taste), stir gently to combine, season to taste and garnish with chopped dill.<br>- Replace frozen green peas with tinned green peas, well drained. Omit steaming in <b>step 4<b> and add peas to the salad in <b>step 5.<b>"],"basicInfo":["easy","20m","1h 10m","8 portions"]}
