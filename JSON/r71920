Use a seasonal fruit of choice to garnish if mangos are not in season. Frozen mango cheeks can be used as well, simply allow to thaw before dicing.","If desired, you can line your ramekins or moulds with plastic wrap first before adding the chopped pistachio nuts, for easier removal after steaming. Ensure there is some plastic wrap hanging over the edges of the ramekin to ensure cheesecakes come out cleanly.","Serve cheesecakes with cream or yoghurt on the side.","Pistachios are botanically related to peaches, nectarines and mangos - making this the perfect dessert to bring these natural partners together.","Any leftover pistachio nuts can be sprinkled on top of yoghurt or bircher muesli for breakfast."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","1h 30m","4 portions"]}
