Discard any clams with broken shells as the clam may be dead or unhealthy. Completely submerge clams in a bowl of cool, fresh water, then cover with a damp kitchen towel and refrigerate for approx. 20 minutes. As the clams are soaking they will naturally purge any salt, sand and particles.<\/p> <p>Drain clams, refresh water and submerge clams again. You can repeat this process 2-3 times if desired to ensure the clams are thoroughly purged. Once purged, scrub off any barnacles, sand or other debris which may be on clam shells.<\/p>"],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","30m","4 portions"]}
