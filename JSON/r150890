For a fresh summer flavour, replace dill with fresh mint or coriander.","<i>Cucumber makes a really refreshing soup. For a creamy white soup, peel the cucumbers and for a pale green soup, leave the skin on. Either way is perfect when you have a bumper crop in the garden! The prawn skewers add a touch of elegance and complement the flavour of the soup.<\/i>","Instead of flour use <b>150 g cooked<b> potatoes, cut in pieces, to thicken the soup.<br>- Use cream instead of milk, or half cream, half milk.<br>- For vegetarian skewers, replace lemon slices with cherry tomatoes and prawns with one or several of the following: small mushrooms <b>(Ø 3 cm),<b> feta cheese cubes, or tofu cubes marinated in soy sauce.<br>- The soup can also be seasoned with a splash of dry white wine."],"basicInfo":["easy","25m","35m","6 portions"]}
