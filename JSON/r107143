Never leave them unattended with Thermomix, while it is running or between steps.","Children can also help with shaping, coating and decorating the cake pops.","For a great finish on your pop, make sure the cake mixture is smooth before coating with chocolate.","Tweezers can be used to apply decorations for a really neat look or sprinkle while turning the cake pop for a continous line.","If you do not have a cake pop stand, a great alternative is to serve cake pops on a tray with the sticks in the air. If you choose to do this focus on decorating the underside area, around the stick.","A mug filled with sugar is a great help to keep your egg pops upright to dry. Once you've dipped your pop in chocolate and decorated it, place them in with enough space so they do not touch each other."],"basicInfo":["medium","1h","2h","14 pieces"]}
