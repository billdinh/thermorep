Alternatively, cook under a hot grill.","The koftas can also be served on their own without sauce - great for a picnic or as a canapé or starter.","The name ‘kofta’ comes from the Arabic for ‘meatballs’ and they take different shapes, sizes and names in many cuisines around the world. Koftas can be served as a starter or a main dish, either dry or as here, made into a curry. They can be made from many different meats including lamb, beef and chicken or even seafood."],"basicInfo":["easy","25m","1h 10m","4 portions"]}
