Divide reserved marzipan in 2 equal pieces and keep wrapped with cling film until needed. Place one piece of marzipan onto a sheet of baking paper, flatten with hands, place a second sheet of baking paper on top and, with a rolling pin, rollout into a rectangular shape (5 mm thick). Trim the edges and cut obtaining 2 rectangular shapes (17 cm x 9-10 cm). Place a log of pistachio paste along the longest edge and roll the marzipan around to enclose the pistachio paste. Seal the joint with some water. Cut the filled roll into 4 pieces (4 cm each). Repeat process until all marzipan and pistachio paste is used up (use the scraps from trimming the edges for the extra 2 pistachio logs).
