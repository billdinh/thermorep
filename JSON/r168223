Divide reserved marzipan in 2 equal pieces and keep wrapped with cling film until needed. Place one piece of marzipan onto a sheet of baking paper, flatten with hands, place a second sheet of baking paper on top and, with a rolling pin, rollout into a rectangular shape (5 mm thick). Trim the edges and cut obtaining 2 rectangular shapes (17 cm x 9-10 cm). Place a log of pistachio paste along the longest edge and roll the marzipan around to enclose the pistachio paste. Seal the joint with some water. Cut the filled roll into 4 pieces (4 cm each). Repeat process until all marzipan and pistachio paste is used up (use the scraps from trimming the edges for the extra 2 pistachio logs). Serve immediately or allow them to dry for a couple of hours before storing."]}],"ingredients":[{"title":"Pistachio paste","content":["60 g sugar","300 g unsalted pistachio nuts","25 g rose water"]},{"title":"Marzipan","content":["300 g sugar","300 g blanched almonds (see tip)","20 g blossom water","10 g rose water"]}],"id":"r168223","imageLink":"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-QqgQM4v1t5k\/XZWereXsuUI\/AAAAAAAAe38\/QubxwSGmmiMxBGEayshNwZc9M4Ni_2IGwCLcBGAsYHQ\/s1600\/0_edPqsF5D_mmh5HSo.png","title":"Marzipan bites","publishedAt":"2018-10-15T00:00:00Z","nutrition":{"protein":"5 g","fat":"13.9 g","uom":"per 1 piece","carbohydrates":"17.7 g","calories":"904 kJ \/ 216 kcal"},"usefulItems":"cling film, baking paper, rolling pin","hintsAndTricks":["To blanch <nobr>500 g almonds<\/nobr> place <nobr>600 g water<\/nobr> into mixing bowl, heat <strong>8 min\/100°C\/speed 3<\/strong>, then add almonds into mixing bowl and boil <strong>3 min\/100°C\/speed <\/strong>.
