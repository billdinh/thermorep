It's available in Middle Eastern delicatessens or specialty food stores. If you can't find it, try combining 1 tbsp mild paprika with 1 tsp cayenne powder instead. Or you can replace the Aleppo pepper with dried chilli flakes in this recipe.","Turkish sausage (sucuk) is usually made with beef and spiced with paprika and fenugreek. It can be found at some continental or Middle Eastern delicatessens. If you are unable to find it, replace the sucuk with salami.","You can find capsicum paste at Middle Eastern delicatessens or specialty food stores. You can replace the capsicum paste with a good-quality tomato paste.","Get the kids involved in making these, as small hands are good for this job. They're fiddly, so make a large batch and freeze the excess. If you want to prepare them ahead of time, you can store them in the freezer for up to 3 months. Just place them into the freezer on a floured baking tray and once frozen, transfer into freezer bags."],"basicInfo":["medium","1h","2h","4 portions"]}
