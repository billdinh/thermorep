We defy you to taste the difference! The meat will be so tender and the flavours are amazing.","This hearty and warming stew can be made ahead and then reheated when needed, making it perfect for a midweek meal or when you have guests.","Any root vegetables can be added depending on what you have available. Try squash, swede, or even potatoes.","Also works well served with crusty bread or rice.","You can use any stout in this one, but we chose the Irish favourite, Guinness. Particularly good when the weather turns colder, this beautifully wholesome and tender beef stew is the perfect winter warmer.
