Merguez are fresh, spicy sausages made from mutton and\/or beef, and are typical of the region. Replace them with any other spicy fresh sausage, or omit them altogether. For a more traditional flavour, replace the cinnamon and ginger with <b>2 tablespoons<b> ras-el-hanout, a North African spice blend that can contain up to <b>40 ingredients.<b>#","The bone in the lamb shoulder meat adds flavour. However if you are cutting the meat yourself, the dish will also be excellent with boneless meat.<br>- If you have some couscous left over, use it to prepare a traditional Moroccan dessert.
