You can choose which of the toppings you would like to use.","To shape pizza, place dough on a baking tray lined with baking paper or greased with extra virgin olive oil. Press it out with your fingertips from the centre to the edges, and gently stretch it into shape. Alternatively you can roll it out with a rolling pin on a floured surface and transfer it to a baking tray lined with baking paper."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","2h 10m","6 portions"]}
