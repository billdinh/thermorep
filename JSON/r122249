If this occurs, steam custards in batches. They will take less time to steam, so be sure to check them after 10 minutes of steaming, then check every few minutes until cooked to your liking.","The custards in the Varoma dish may cook more quickly and may need to be removed sooner than those on the Varoma tray."],"basicInfo":["easy","15m","45m","6 portions"]}
