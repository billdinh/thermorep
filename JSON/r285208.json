To check your chicken is cooked, pierce the thickest part of the leg near the chest. If the juices run clear, it is cooked.","Change the vegetables to suit your taste and adjust cooking times as required for firmer or softer vegetables.","This impressive recipe produces a two-course chicken dinner in under two hours. First, a tasty butternut squash soup cooks as a whole chicken steams in the Varoma, guaranteeing incredibly tender and moist meat. Steamed fresh vegetables and a flavourful red wine gravy complete the main course, resulting in a delicious and simple dinner for six."],"basicInfo":["medium","30m","2h","6 portions"]}
