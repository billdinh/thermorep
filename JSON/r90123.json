For a creamy white soup, peel the cucumbers, and for a pale green soup, leave the skin on. Either way is perfect when you have a bumper crop in the garden. The prawn skewers add a touch of elegance and complement the flavour of the soup.","Instead of flour use <b>150 g cooked<b> potatoes, cut in pieces, to thicken the soup.","Use cream instead of milk, or half cream, half milk.","For vegetarian skewers, replace lemon slices with cherry tomatoes and prawns with one or several of the following: small mushrooms <b>(Ø 3 cm),<b> feta cheese cubes, or tofu cubes marinated in soy sauce.","The soup can also be seasoned with a splash of dry white wine.","If using frozen prawns, defrost before marinating.","Unpeeled cucumbers give more colour and flavour to the soup.","Long skewers can be cut to fit the Varoma dish.","In hot weather this soup can be served chilled. For a fresh summer flavour, replace dill with fresh mint or coriander."],"basicInfo":["easy","25m","35m","6 portions"]}
