Allow to rest for one minute before serving.","If using mussels, they should be added later in the cooking process because they cook more quickly than the shrimp and clams and will get rubbery if overcooked.","Discard any mussels that are open before cooking and do not open up after steaming.","Using a large paella pan on a stovetop may require straddling 2 burners. You want all the edges to cook evenly.
