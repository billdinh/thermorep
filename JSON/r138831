Before using, bring the icing back to room temperature or stir until soft enough to spread.","You can use a small spirit level to ensure your cake is level. As you build your cake, after every level, check and adjust accordingly using ganache to get a straight and level cake.","We used half a batch of our Simple butter biscuit recipe to make the biscuits used for decoration on our cake. We also used a batch of our Royal icing to decorate biscuits. Please refer to the recipes on this recipe chip.","Get creative with your cake! You can make the cakes any flavour you like and you can make the Buttercream icing into any colour (or flavour) you like. Decorate your cake with biscuits, lollies, fondant decorations, edible flowers, etc. Use your imagination to create cakes for any occasion!"],"basicInfo":["medium","1h 30m","5h 45m","24 portions"]}
