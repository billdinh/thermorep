For example, you can make your own vanilla sugar, or soak the pod in milk for desserts.","Store baharat spice mix in an airtight container for future use.","Sumac is a widely used spice mix, with a slight lemony flavour. It is available in most supermarkets or online.","Sumac has a tendency to deteriorate when cooked. It is therefore preferable not to overcook it. It can also make food very salty.
