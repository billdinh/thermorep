                <h4 id="preparation-step-3-title">Colouring fondant</h4>
              <ol>
                  <li id="preparation-step--3-0">Place a sealable container onto mixing bowl lid and weigh 950 g of the fondant into it. Set aside for covering teapot, teacups with handles, spout and lid. Place a seperate sealable container onto mixing bowl lid and weigh 250 g fondant into it. Place another sealable container onto mixing bowl lid and weigh 250 g fondant into it. Set these 2 containers aside for teapot decorations (ex: diamonds, balls, etc). Divide remaining 50 g fondant into 2 x 25 g portions for other extra decorations (ex: hearts, streamers, etc).</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--3-1">Working 1 batch at a time, place fondant onto a dusted silicone bread mat or work surface. We coloured the teapot and cups (950 g portion) light blue and the decorations (2 x 250 g portions) teal and purple, and the other decorations (2 x 25 g) pink and black. Add a small amount of colouring to your fondant and knead until there are no streaks. If fondant feels sticky, add some extra sifted icing sugar. Transfer coloured fondant back into separate sealable containers and set aside until required.</li>
              </ol>
                <h4 id="preparation-step-4-title">Modelling paste</h4>
              <ol>
                  <li id="preparation-step--4-0">Weigh out 200 g from the 950 g portion of fondant. Place remaining 750 g fondant back into a sealable container and set aside. Add ½ teaspoon tylose to 200 g portion and knead for 3-5 minutes to fully incorporate tylose and until paste is smooth and crease free. This will help avoid cracks. If the paste feels too dry or crumbly, or if cracks persist, rub some vegetable shortening onto your palms and work surface and continue to knead until smooth and crease free.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--4-1">To make our teapot lid (approx. 60 g), roll modelling paste to 5 mm thickness. Cut out a disc (10 cm diameter) from modelling paste and set over a small dome shape (ex: base of a bowl) to create a lid shape. Use any excess modelling paste to shape into a ball and secure on top of lid with edible sugar glue. Set aside to dry overnight.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--4-2">To make teapot spout (approx. 60 g), roll modelling paste into an 8-10 cm length. Form into a curved spout, with an indent at one end and a thicker base at the other, angled to attach to curve of teapot. Insert 3 toothpicks into thicker base and set aside to dry overnight.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--4-3">To make teapot handle (approx. 60 g), roll modelling paste into a 15 cm length. Form into a 'S' shape to create a handle. Insert a toothpick into each end and set aside to dry overnight.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--4-4">To make teacup handles (approx. 20 g), roll fondant into a 20 cm length, then cut into 4 equal pieces. Shape into a 'C' shape, and insert half a toothpick into each end. Set aside to dry overnight.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--4-5">Add 1/8 teaspoon tylose to each 25 g portion and knead for 1-2 minutes to fully incorporate tylose and until paste is smooth and crease free. To make teapot 'sparklers', roll out each 25 g portion to 5 mm thickness. Cut out shapes as desired (stars, butterflies and streamers). Insert a wire into each shape (except streamers) to decorate teapot at end of assembly. Set aside to dry overnight.</li>
              </ol>
                <h4 id="preparation-step-5-title">Assembly</h4>
              <ol>
                  <li id="preparation-step--5-0">Trim top and base of each sphere cake to create level surfaces. Trim off domed top of 4 cupcakes and set bases aside.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--5-1">Spread 2-3 tablesoons of the icing over larger level surface of 1 sphere cake. Place other sphere cake, larger level side down, over icing and press together lightly to form a ball. Place 1 teaspoon of the icing onto a large cake board to secure cake.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--5-2">Spread a thin layer of icing (crumb coat) over teapot to create a smooth surface. Spread a thin layer of icing (crumb coat) over each cupcake (teacups) to create a smooth surface. Transfer cake and cupcakes into refrigerator until firm to the touch (10-15 minutes).</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--5-3">Weigh out approx. 500 g fondant from the 750 g portion. Roll 500 g portion out to 5 mm thickness (45-50 cm diameter) to cover your teapot. Lay fondant over teapot and work out any creases to create a smooth surface. Trim off any excess fondant at base, then neaten and tuck in edges.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--5-4">Roll out each 250 g portion of the coloured fondants (ex: diamonds) to approx. 2 mm thickness. Cut out desired shapes (e.g. diamonds) from each portion to decorate teapot, teacups and lid. Attach decorations to teapot and teapot lid with sugar glue as desired. Use any remaining coloured fondant to roll into small balls. Place balls around base of teapot.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--5-5">Insert 4 x 5 cm wooden skewers into top of teapot and place lid into position over skewers.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--5-6">Attach teapot spout and handle to teapot.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--5-7">Roll out remaining 250 g fondant to 5 mm thickness. Using a cookie cutter (10 cm), cut out 4 circles to cover tea cups. Place 1 fondant circle over base of each cupcake and shape to fit. Attach 1 handle to each tea cup. Attach decorations (e.g diamonds) to teacups with sugar glue as desired.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--5-8">Roll out excess fondant to 5 mm thickness. Using a cookie cutter (7.5 cm), cut out 4 circles to use as saucers. Arrange saucers around teapot.

                <ul>
          <li>Start this recipe 2 days in advance. Cake will keep at room temperature after assembly. Serve cake within 1 day of completing recipe.</li>
          <li>Make sure that your butter is softened to avoid lumps and air bubbles in your cake.</li>
          <li>We recommend using soft, sifted icing sugar for this recipe.</li>
          <li>This recipe makes 4 more cupcakes than needed. You can store cupcakes in the refrigerator or freezer, or make extra fondant and make more teacups.</li>
          <li>If you are not using buttercream icing immediately, place into refrigerator until ready to use. To use, bring icing back to room temperature or stir until softened enough to spread.</li>
          <li>Glycerine is an edible product and can be purchased from cake decorating shops or the health and beauty aisle in supermarkets.</li>
          <li>Tylose is a vegetable gum, available from cake decorating supply stores; when added to fondant it makes it set more firmly. Use 1½-2 tsp tylose for every 500 g fondant, depending on the texture and moisture in your fondant.</li>
          <li>Edible sugar glue can be purchased from cake decorating stores or online.</li>
          <li>Fondant will keep for up to 2 months at room temperature. Liquid food colouring may affect the texture of your fondant and modelling paste; add sifted icing sugar as needed. Once your fondant or modelling paste is coloured, try to avoid excess use of icing sugar when rolling or modelling as this will leave white marks.</li>
          <li>Always keep fondant/modelling paste wrapped in plastic wrap inside a snap lock bag since it dries out quickly. Work quickly with modelling paste and keep excess in a sealed container while working with it.</li>
